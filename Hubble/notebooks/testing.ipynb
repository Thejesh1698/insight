Is a car going to pick me up?\" Risher said. \"We guarantee we\\'re going to pick you up. If we are more than ten minutes late, we will pay you up to $100 in Lyft cash.\" Risher said over the past few weeks, Lyft has given 2.5 million rides to the airport and only had to reimburse 72 rides for late pick-ups. Lyft has struggled in the ride-share space since its 2019 initial public offering, with competitor Uber pulling ahead in terms of market share and market capitalization. Risher reported steady improvement at the company since he took the reigns in April, with ride growth up 20% in the most recent quarter. Risher also said employee satisfaction levels at the company are the highest in four years after hitting a historic low when he began his tenure. \"We just saw the results, just yesterday, of our most recent [employee satisfaction survey],\" he said. \"What that tells you is that the thousands and thousands – 3000 plus team members who work for Lyft – are starting to believe.

       "  'cleaned_text': \" New Delhi: The cost of home-cooked vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals, or thali, fell sequentially in December, following the end of the festival season. The price of a vegetarian thali fell 3% to ₹ 29.7 last month, while non-vegetarian thali saw a 5% decline to ₹ 57.6, according to rating agency Crisil. Year-on-year, the cost of a vegetarian thali increased, whereas non-vegetarian thali became cheaper. A typical vegetarian thali includes roti, vegetables (onion, tomato, potato), rice, dal, curd, and salad. The non-vegetarian version replaces dal with chicken (broiler). Despite fluctuating commodity prices, the share of ingredients used for arriving at the prices remains constant. Crisil attributed the drop in the vegetarian thali's cost to a 14% and 3% decrease in onion and tomato prices, respectively, as festive demand waned. The more significant decline in the non-vegetarian thali's cost was driven by a 5-7% reduction in broiler prices, which constitute half of the thali's cost. However, on a yearly basis, onion and tomato prices increased, leading to a 12% rise in the cost of the vegetarian thali. This increase was primarily due to an 82% jump in onion prices and a 42% surge in tomato prices. Pulse prices, contributing 9% to the vegetarian thali cost, also rose 24%. Conversely, the non-vegetarian thali's cost fell 4% due to a 15% yearly decline in broiler prices amid higher production. Nishant Lakkar, founder and CEO of AAA Rating Consultants and Advisors (AAARCA), noted that the poultry sector has been facing losses since December and will likely continue this trend. This is due to factors like rising bird weights, due to weather conditions, a slight increase in maize prices, and lower realizations. Lakkar mentioned a marginal improvement in realizations around Christmas and New Year, but anticipates the sector to have barely broken even in Q3, despite a strong performance in October. Prices of rice, wheat, pulses, and vegetables are expected to remain high for the rest of the fiscal year. Wheat and rice prices are seen firm due to lower stocks in the central pool, Pushan Sharma, director, research, CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics, had told Mint earlier. Prices of pulses are expected to rise due to a tight supply situation amid a likely fall in Kharif output and lower acreage in the ongoing Rabi season. Vegetables prices, especially those of tomatoes and onions, will also remain high until new crop arrivals begin. The Reserve Bank of India during its rate-setting meeting last month warned of a about a possible resurgence in food inflation. The government has been taking several measures recently to rein in food prices as the Consumer Food Price Index, which accounts for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket, rose to 8.70% in November from 6.61% in October.

Over the past three years alone, the shares have surged from ₹ 14.20 per share to ₹ 93.70 apiece, resulting in a massive return of 560%. According to projections made by domestic brokerage firm Ventura Securities, the bullish momentum of the stock is poised to persist. The brokerage firm in its January 06 research note has initiated coverage on the stock with a \\'buy\\' rating and set a 24-month target price of ₹ 148 apiece, reflecting an upside of 57.46%.

Established in 1973, Sadhana Nitro Chem is a leading manufacturer specialising in intermediate specialty chemicals. It operates from its state-of-the-art 22-acre facility in Roha and holds the esteemed status of a 2-Star Golden Export House, with a notable 80% of its sales dedicated to exports. In 2021, the company was recognised under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for manufacturing 36,000 TPA of PAP, and its current production run rate stands at 3,000 TPA. This, according to the brokerage, heralds a significant opportunity for the company, positioning it as the second global manufacturer of PAP (following Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals) through the nitrobenzene route. PAP manufactured from nitrobenzene has negligible impurities compared to other manufacturing processes and hence commands a significant pricing premium in international markets, it added.

Share hits lifetime high Despite having a promising product portfolio, the financial performance of the company was not reflecting its true potential, the brokerage noted. Even three years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company posted a revenue of ₹ 143 crore in FY23, 46% lower than the ₹ 267 crore clocked in FY2019. Looking forward, the brokerage holds a bullish outlook on the company\\'s growth prospects, citing a notable improvement in the overall business environment. It said that the reduction in Chinese manufacturers\\' production, coupled with decreased demand for Chinese products, will create a more favorable pricing environment. In FY24, the company\\'s introduction of the in-house MMDPA facility will stabilise ODB2 production and margins. Additionally, the brokerage anticipates that the scale-up in PAP production will contribute to increased revenues. Also Read : Stocks to buy this week: Zomato, CAMS, REC among 12 technical picks In light of these developments, the brokerage forecasts a CAGR of 73.8% in revenue, 102.3% in EBITDA, and 214.1% in PAT from FY23 to FY26. Furthermore, margins (EBITDA/PAT) are projected to improve by 730/850 basis points to 23.1/12.4% during the forecast period. Consequently, return ratios ROE and ROIC are poised to expand to 22.2% and 26.7%, respectively. Moreover, the brokerage expects the company\\'s working capital cycle to shrink substantially to 215 days in FY26 from the prior 377 days (FY23).

       "  'cleaned_text': ' Stock market today: Domestic equity benchmarks the Sensex and the Nifty 50 ended with significant losses on Monday, January 8, amid weak global cues. The market indices halted their upward trend of two days as investors opted to book profits ahead of the release of inflation data and crucial earnings reports scheduled for this week. Now, attention in the market turns towards the upcoming inflation reports from the US and India, slated for Thursday and Friday, respectively. Additionally, with the earnings season underway and market valuations sitting at elevated levels, the significance of robust earnings becomes paramount in preventing a potential market correction. Sensex closed with a loss of 671 points, or 0.93 per cent, at 71,355.22 while the Nify 50 ended the day at 21,513, down 198 points, or 0.91 per cent. Mid and smallcap indices also ended with losses but their decline was smaller in magnitude compared to the benchmarks. The BSE Midcap index lost 0.87 per cent while the Smallcap index ended 0.36 per cent lower. The overall market capitalisation of the firms listed on the BSE dropped to nearly ₹ 366.5 lakh crore from nearly ₹ 369.3 lakh crore in the previous session, making investors poorer by about ₹ 2.8 lakh crore in a single session. (Exciting news Mint is now on WhatsApp Channels. Subscribe today and stay updated with the latest financial insights  ) Here are five main reasons why the Sensex and the Nifty 50 fell on Monday: 1. Weak global cues Major Asian peers, including the Shanghai Composite Index, Hang Seng and KOSPI closed in the red weighing on domestic market sentiment. Among the European peers, FTSE, CAC and DAX traded lower when the domestic market ended. \"Asian shares slipped into the red on Monday as Chinese stocks extended their recent retreat, and investors braced for US inflation data and a corporate reporting season where robust results are needed to justify high valuations,\" reported Reuters. 2. Caution ahead of Q3 earnings Domestic market sentiment is cautious ahead of the December quarter earnings of India Inc. IT majors Infosys and TCS will report their Q3 scorecard on Thursday, January 11. IT firms are expected to post muted revenue and subdued profit for Q3 amid weak demand. Also Read: Q3 result preview: IT firms expected to post muted revenue, subdued profit amid weak demand Overall, the December quarter earnings of Indian corporates are unlikely to throw a negative surprise. However, experts believe there could be some sequential moderation in some sectors due to high base and sectoral headwinds. Also Read: Q3 Result: India Inc. may deliver moderate profit, negative surprises unlikely; here\\'s what experts say \"In the near term, investors’ trade positions will be more inclined towards the upcoming result season. While the outset may be tempered by lower expectations in the IT sector, the overall forecast for earnings growth remains optimistic, projecting double-digit figures,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services. 3. Rate cut hopes weaken The hopes of an early rate cut by the US Federal Reserve are slowly diminishing. The recent data showed the US labour market is still resilient. The focus is now on the US inflation data expected on Thursday which could influence market expectations on the Fed\\'s move on interest rates. According to Reuters, quoting the CME FedWatch Tool, market pricing now shows a roughly 64 per cent chance that the Fed could begin easing rates as early as March, compared to a nearly 90 per cent chance a week ago. \"The concern in the US now is that the market expectation of a rate cut in March may not materialise since the labour market continues to be tight and the unemployment data is lower than expected,\" V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, observed. 4. Geopolitical tensions remain in focus Investors are closely watching geopolitical events. Houthi rebels are targeting commercial ships in the Red Sea amid the escalating Israel-Hamas conflict. The Red Sea is the entry point for ships using the Suez Canal and is important for the movement of goods between Asia and Europe. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that \"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was holding more talks with Arab leaders on Monday as part of a diplomatic push to stop the war in Gaza from spreading further.\" 5. Technical factors Technical indicators are showing a change in market sentiment. As Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities observed, Nifty ended the day close to its support at 21,500 and the short-term 14-day moving average, accompanied by a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern. \"This indicates a change in market sentiment. If 21,500 is breached in closing figures, Nifty may move towards the next support level at 21,200. The support of 21,500, if held, can see recovery towards 21,650 which is the immediate hurdle zone,\" said Shah.

       "  'cleaned_text': ' Venture capital investors are scaling their cyber security investments on the back of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and rising instances of data security breaches. Indian cybersecurity startups in the last two years amassed fund inflows of about $130.7 million, nearly a 63% jump from two years prior, according to data collected by Tracxn. With a boom in technological enhancements incorporated across multiple sectors in India and worldwide, data and security breaches continue to be a cause of concern for companies and individuals which has encouraged investors to invest more proactively. VC firm Accel is currently investing out of its seventh fund, sized at $650 million, and has invested from this fund in five companies in the cybersecurity space, said Prayank Swaroop, partner at Accel. “Cybersecurity is an important area of investment for us globally, and in India we have significantly increased our number of investments in the last two years. This will continue to be a priority sector for 2024 as well.\" While the government has also brought in more initiatives to promote rapid digitization, this further exposes entities to malicious activities through ransomware attacks, credential thefts, supply chain attacks, among many others. These security breaches could lead to substantial losses for organizations and may have severe repercussions, thus making it even more crucial to allocate funds to tackle these concerns. With the current rate of growth, damage from cyberattacks will amount to about $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, a 2022 McKinsey report said. “New ways to secure customer-specific information are expected to emerge, enabling organizations to implement substantial measures swiftly at a considerable pace and magnitude,\" Google-backed cybersecurity firm Mandiant\\'s CTO for JAPAC and Google Cloud, Steve Ledzian,\\xa0told Mint . About 97% of Indian organizations have begun investing in AI/ML while 84% have also put in money for infrastructure around cloud technology, according to the Data Security Council of India. “The intersection of AI with cybersecurity is poised to drive a significant increase in investments in the sector this year. The recent adoption of Generative AI is also opening various cybersecurity risks. We expect a few investment opportunities coming to us in AI governance and cyber security governance areas.\" said Shyam Penumaka, partner at Dallas Venture Capital (DVC) adding that AI technologies, such as machine learning and behavioural analytics, are proving to be game changers in the cybersecurity space. However, about 90% of Indian business leaders see a significant cyber threat to their business, according to data collected by consulting firm PwC. The report also said cyber security continues to have a share of 10%-15% of IT budgets within Indian enterprises as cyber-attacks are posing an increasing threat to business operations. Nearly all the organizations will increase their cyber budgets, out of which 50% envisaged an increase between 6% and 15% in the next 12 months, as per the report. As a result, fund-backers have become more optimistic about investing in this sector. “We have been bullish for a while on the cybersecurity ecosystem out of India and have hence backed a few companies in this space,\" head of venture capital firm RPG Ventures, Kunjan Chikhlikar said. It has invested in companies such as Shieldsquare, a bot mitigation business and cybersecurity firm BluSapphire. Several industry experts and executives also said India gains from a structural advantage in security as it houses a large number of security engineers, making it a more attractive market for investors. “We\\'re seeing a lot of cybersecurity services companies in India transition to product companies. We\\'ve also seen a lot of security engineers in the US coming back to India and building security products for the world, and these trends are only on the rise,\" said Accel’s Swaroop. Still, cybersecurity firms continue to face challenges in keeping pace with the rapidly evolving technological advancements due to factors that include complex regulatory landscapes, balancing security measures with user experience and addressing global threat variations. Additionally, the frequency of cyberattacks globally and in India has also challenged the readiness of Indian companies. Experts at DVC have said navigating through this complicated landscape involves continuous innovation, interoperability solutions, advanced threat intelligence, talent development, and targeted user awareness programmes. “This multi-vector environment is challenging to traverse for budding cybersecurity companies which must not only build cutting edge technology solutions but also find the product market fit with their target customers,\" DVC’s Penumaka added. DVC, which expects an increase in global spending, estimates about 14% jump specifically in the Indian cybersecurity market. The firm forecast 95% of Indian organizations to increase their cybersecurity budget by at least 10% over the next 12 months, compared to 86% globally. Despite increased VC investment in this burgeoning market, experts believe that the market has not reached its full potential. “Cybersecurity landscape is definitely coming up…I would say this is the very early stage of the cybersecurity ecosystem when it comes to manpower and product development. The expertise exists but I think it would take another 5-10 years before the market matures,\" Peak XV Partners-backed cybersecurity startup SquareX’s founder Vivek Ramachandran told Mint in an interview.

       "'headline: Thali costs fall in December  Mint.  content:  New Delhi: The cost of home-cooked vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals or thali fell sequentially in December following the end of the festival season. The price of a vegetarian thali fell 3% to ₹ 29.7 last month while non-vegetarian thali saw a 5% decline to ₹ 57.6 according to rating agency Crisil. Year-on-year the cost of a vegetarian thali increased whereas non-vegetarian thali became cheaper. A typical vegetarian thali includes roti vegetables (onion tomato potato) rice dal curd and salad. The non-vegetarian version replaces dal with chicken (broiler). Despite fluctuating commodity prices the share of ingredients used for arriving at the prices remains constant. Crisil attributed the drop in the vegetarian thalis cost to a 14% and 3% decrease in onion and tomato prices respectively as festive demand waned. The more significant decline in the non-vegetarian thalis cost was driven by a 5-7% reduction in broiler prices which constitute half of the thalis cost. However on a yearly basis onion and tomato prices increased leading to a 12% rise in the cost of the vegetarian thali. This increase was primarily due to an 82% jump in onion prices and a 42% surge in tomato prices. Pulse prices contributing 9% to the vegetarian thali cost also rose 24%. Conversely the non-vegetarian thalis cost fell 4% due to a 15% yearly decline in broiler prices amid higher production. Nishant Lakkar founder and CEO of AAA Rating Consultants and Advisors (AAARCA) noted that the poultry sector has been facing losses since December and will likely continue this trend. This is due to factors like rising bird weights due to weather conditions a slight increase in maize prices and lower realizations. Lakkar mentioned a marginal improvement in realizations around Christmas and New Year but anticipates the sector to have barely broken even in Q3 despite a strong performance in October. Prices of rice wheat pulses and vegetables are expected to remain high for the rest of the fiscal year. Wheat and rice prices are seen firm due to lower stocks in the central pool Pushan Sharma director research CRISIL Market Intelligence and Analytics had told Mint earlier. Prices of pulses are expected to rise due to a tight supply situation amid a likely fall in Kharif output and lower acreage in the ongoing Rabi season. Vegetables prices especially those of tomatoes and onions will also remain high until new crop arrivals begin. The Reserve Bank of India during its rate-setting meeting last month warned of a about a possible resurgence in food inflation. The government has been taking several measures recently to rein in food prices as the Consumer Food Price Index which accounts for nearly half of the overall consumer price basket rose to 8.70% in November from 6.61% in October.
