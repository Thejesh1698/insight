With the Digital Personal Data Protection Act’s intervention, the digital lending space will witness a new regulatory framework pertaining to data privacy Although its implementation will be exhausting, in the long run, it stores the answer to building a financially inclusive and safe economy FOLLOW US FOLLOW US Added to Saved Stories in Login VIEW SAVED STORIES In an age permeated by technology, India has been cognizant of its usage, penetration and implications. While characterising every facet of technology in business operations, its potential in the digital lending arena has led RBI to launch a series of initiatives and schemes to bring more clarity on how critical information has to be handled. As India is advancing towards becoming a formidable economy, the digital transformation scenario poses serious concerns about data privacy and security, specifically in the digital lending landscape. In addition to safeguarding data, the early roots of data-centric regulatory requirements emerged in the form of RBI’s guidelines on digital lending for finance companies and banks. This clearly outlined the non-uniform data management standards that resulted in abundant inconsistencies in lending practices. These guidelines successfully ensured uniformity and onboarded a considerable portion of unregulated lenders into a regulated lending space. However, it also brought the need to add another layer of data protection and privacy to the forefront, making India introduce its first Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Understanding Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 Committed to establishing a robust framework associated with data protection, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) marks a significant step in achieving complete data protection and privacy. Within its scope, the key areas have been safeguarding consumer data, whilst developing effective privacy governance programs for managing reputational and business risks. Delving into the digital lending landscape, it acts as a catalyst to bolster digital lenders to create transparent and future-ready organisations. Further, its stringent guidelines on the financial services sector will be instrumental in delivering greater authority to customers regarding data, paving the way for customer-centric digital lending.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has an overarching vision of ‘Insurance for all’ by 2047. This means by 2047 every citizen should have appropriate life, health and property insurance cover. Keeping this in mind, the upcoming interim Union Budget is expected to outline strategic initiatives to propel the sector towards inclusive growth. The government is anticipated to introduce key measures that will hopefully encourage and nudge people to purchase adequate insurance.

Further, to increase penetration, the government, in its upcoming Budget, can look to announce tax exemptions for first-time medical insurance buyers. The government can introduce an exemption under chapter VIA for such first-time insurance buyers of up to 200 percent of the premium paid, which can then be subsequently reduced to the threshold under section 80D in a phased manner over a 3-4-year period. Another way to increase penetration would be to incentivise insurance companies to build products covering out-patient treatments, which usually constitute around 50-60 percent of healthcare spending. The government can announce a lower GST on such products.

Here, to reduce the mortality protection gap, the government can bring in a threshold-based tax exemption such that if an assessee has bought term insurance and/or an annuity product, both with a pre-defined minimum cover threshold (relative to annual taxable income), the assessee could be eligible for additional tax exemption under Chapter VIA, to the extent of the premium paid on such policies. Also read: Union Budget 2024: Life insurers want tax-free annuity income, term insurance benefit under new regime Uninsured vehicles on roads More than 50 percent of vehicles in India are still uninsured despite compulsory third-party Insurance. There could be various reasons why people don’t buy a third-party cover, including costs, negligence or simply the belief that ‘Insurance is not required’. The government could incentivise such owners of vehicles by a one-time tax exemption for renewal of their insurance policy. Protecting homes against natural catastrophes India is witnessing a rise in natural calamities like earthquakes, landslides, and floods. We witnessed roughly 765 natural catastrophe events since 1900. In fact, between 2001 and 2021, the total number of such events stood at about 354. This has resulted in huge economic losses for the masses. To address this issue, the government can provide a separate limit for deduction of up to Rs 25,000 against the premium paid for property insurance. Also, the government can consider directing the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) to make home insurance compulsory for homeowners at the time of buying the property. Exempting travel insurance under LTA Between January and December 2023, Indian domestic airlines saw 22.5 lakh passengers being affected due to flight delays and 2.84 lakh passengers due to flight cancellations.

The development comes at a time when AI has started taking centre stage across the world as well as in India and the user base for AI applications and services is growing at a rapid pace. “This rapid development [of AI] has raised substantial concerns about the risks associated with uncontrolled AI propagation. The increasing capabilities of AI systems bring potential dangers, such as the prospect of “runaway AI” (under-controlled AI),” said the EAC-PM in its paper. “This and other more substantiated concerns have led to a growing demand for regulatory frameworks that ensure AI development and deployment are conducted safely, ethically, and transparently, safeguarding against risks like systemic breakdowns, loss of privacy, national security threats, and compromised critical infrastructure,” it mentioned. However, the traditional risk assessment methods fall short in today’s time due to AI’s non-linear, unpredictable nature. AI systems are akin to CAS, where components interact and evolve in unpredictable ways, the paper said. To effectively regulate AI (algorithm, training data sets, models, and applications), the paper has proposed a “novel” framework based on CAS thinking.

The council is of the opinion that traditional regulatory mechanisms often lag the rapid pace of AI evolution. Hence, a dedicated expert regulatory body with a broad mandate and the ability to respond swiftly would be pivotal to ensuring that governance remains proactive and effective. Having a dedicated regulatory body would also entail having a national registry of algorithms as compliance and a repository of national algorithms for innovations in AI, the EAC-PM said. Besides, it also noted that open licencing of core algorithms for external audits, AI factsheets, and continuous monitoring of AI systems is crucial for accountability, which asks for mandatory periodic}\"]"
