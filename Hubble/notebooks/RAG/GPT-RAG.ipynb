BNPL apps partner with retailers to make it easier for consumers to buy products online then pay for them over time. BNPL orders were up 78% from Nov. 19 to Nov. 25 compared to the week prior according to Adobe Analytics. The firm tracks more than 85% of the top 100 internet retailers in the U.S. About 40% of consumers said they will finance one or more of their holiday purchases this year including with credit cards personal loans and BNPL apps according to a study by LendingTree and PYMTS. And the likelihood that consumers will finance their purchases increases with their financial strain. About 52% of people who reported they live paycheck-to-paycheck or who struggle to pay their bills plan to finance holiday spending. Thanksgiving Holidays Record-Breaking Sales Consumers making purchases online spent a record $11.3 billion on Cyber Monday up from 5.8% from spending on the same day last year according to Adobe Analytics which tracks more than 85% of the top 100 internet retailers in the U.S. Spending on Black Friday hit $9.12 billion up 2.3% from Black Friday last year. Meanwhile shoppers also flocked back to stores in record numbers over the holiday weekend. From Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday 19.7 million shoppers returned to in-person shopping according to the National Retail Federation. Overall with both online and in-person shopping a record 196.7 shoppers made purchases over that five-day period up 9% from the same period last year. The NRF had expected 166.3 million shoppers. As inflationary pressures persist consumers have responded by stretching their dollars in any way possible Matthew Shay NRF president and CEO said in a statement. Retailers have responded accordingly offering shoppers a season of buying convenience matching sales and promotions across online and in-store channels.\\n|article_end|\\n<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\n\",\n",

       "'title: XIRR vs CAGR: Which is the right way to calculate mutual fund returns? | Mint. published_date: 2023-10-19T11:42:31+05:30. content:  Before you start investing in the mutual funds, you should ideally examine the past returns of all the schemes that you want to invest into. And since there are a number of ways to calculate the past returns, you should opt for the one that suits you the most. For instance, XIRR and CAGR are among the two most preferred parameters that are used to calculate the returns on various investment products including mutual fund returns. Most investors get confused as to which parameter should one go for. Why should one measure the return on investment on their mutual fund investment in the first place? To find this out we have to\\xa0explore XIRR and CAGR in detail to understand which method is the right way to calculate mutual fund returns. What is XIRR? XIRR\\xa0stands for extended internal rate of return. It is a method that is used to calculate the annualised return on investment when cash flows happen at irregular intervals. It takes into account all cash inflows and outflows, along with the dates on which they occur, to calculate the annual rate of return. XIRR considers the timing and amount of each cash flow, making it a more accurate method for investments with irregular cash flows. What is CAGR? CAGR\\xa0stands for\\xa0Compound Annual Growth Rate and is a method that is used to calculate the annualised return on investment when cash flows occur at regular intervals. It assumes a constant rate of growth over a specific period and calculates the average rate of return during that period. CAGR is useful for understanding the growth rate of an investment over time and is commonly used for long-term investments like mutual funds. XIRR vs CAGR XIRR is commonly used when evaluating mutual funds with irregular cash flows. This could be the case when an investor makes additional investments or withdrawals at different points in time. XIRR takes into account the timing and amount of each cash flow, providing a more accurate measure of the annualised return. It accounts for the compounding effect of investing or withdrawing funds at different periods, making it useful for comparing returns of funds with different investment patterns. CAGR, on the other hand, is commonly used when evaluating mutual funds with regular cash flows. It assumes a constant rate of growth over a specific period, making it ideal for comparing funds that have a consistent investment pattern. CAGR provides a simplified measure of the average annual return over a specified time period, making it useful for long-term investment analysis. Dev Ashish, a SEBI registered investment advisor, and Founder, StableInvestor , says, “ While CAGR can be used to calculate returns from lumpsum investment in mutual funds, it is advisable to use XIRR for calculating returns from periodic (non lump sum) investments like SIP. Suppose you invest ₹ 1 lakh lump sum in 2017. After 5 years, the value of this becomes ₹ 2 lakh in 2022. In this case we use CAGR to calculate returns from lumpsum investments. This comes to 14.87% CAGR.\" Mukesh Vijayvergia, Founder of Nishkaera Financial Advisory and Wealth Management, echoes the same sentiments. “While CAGR measures the annualised compounded return on investment for a certain period, assuming reinvestment of profits; XIRR measures the average return earned by the investor after factoring in periodic cash flows separately during the stipulated period,\" Vijayvergia says. Which one to choose? When it comes to calculating mutual fund returns, it is important to choose the method that suits the investment pattern and cash flow behaviour of the fund. If the fund has irregular cash flows, such as additional investments or withdrawals at different points in time, XIRR is the preferred method. It provides a more accurate measure of the annualised return, accounting for the timing and amount of each cash flow. On the other hand, if the fund has regular cash flows and a constant growth rate, CAGR is the preferred method. It gives a simplified measure of the average annual return over a specified time period, making it suitable for long-term investment analysis. In conclusion, XIRR and CAGR are both important tools for calculating returns on mutual funds, but they serve different purposes. XIRR is useful for investments with irregular cash flows, while CAGR is suitable for investments with regular cash flows. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each method, investors can make better-informed decisions and accurately calculate returns on their mutual funds. '"

       "'title: What is XIRR in Mutual Funds: Calculation & Formula in Excel. published_date: 2023-02-13T11:50:00+00:00. content: XIRR or Extended Internal Rate of Return helps calculate the return on mutual fund investments made through SIP (Systematic Investment Plan). CEO of Navi Mutual Fund, Hari Shyamsunder says, “Your investments should always be compared against a possible alternative. But to make that comparison, you must understand the basic concept of XIRR.” This article is a beginner’s guide to understanding the XIRR meaning in mutual funds, its importance and the calculation of your SIP returns. Read on! What is XIRR in Mutual Funds? XIRR Meaning – XIRR (Extended Internal Rate of Return) can be defined as a computation method for calculating returns of mutual fund investments at irregular intervals. It can also be defined as a single rate of return which can be applicable for every instalment and redemption. You can use it to have an understanding of the current value of all your investments. When you invest in a scheme via SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) , you need to pay multiple instalments. You can easily calculate the returns of these investments with the help of IRR (Internal Rate of Return), but, you need to make sure that the time frame between the consecutive cash flows remains the same.The XIRR method simplifies the entire process of calculating returns even in the case of irregular investments. You can simply use an excel sheet to calculate your investment returns. Here, the XIRR formula will modify the IRR and enable you to allocate separate dates to individual cash flows. XIRR Formula and Calculation To calculate XIRR in mutual funds, you have to insert the transactions (additional purchases, SIP/SWP instalments, redemption) and the corresponding dates in the designated place in an MS Excel sheet. These transaction details will be available in the statement of account sent by the AMC (Asset Management Company) . To calculate a mutual fund’s XIRR, you can use the XIRR formula in MS Excel: “= XIRR (values, dates, guess)” Here, you have to insert cash outflows (lump-sum purchases and SIP instalments) as negative values (i.e. put a minus sign before the amount) and cash inflows (dividends, SWP, redemptions) as positive values. ‘Guess’ is an optional input. It is considered to be 0.1 by default. If you have not redeemed your mutual fund units, then, to calculate XIRR, you have to enter the current investment value with the NAV (Net Asset Value) of your mutual fund investment. Do not include transactions like dividend reinvestment because they do not involve actual cash flows. Moreover, if you are calculating the XIRR at the level of schemes, then switches should be treated as redemption. But, if you are calculating XIRR in mutual funds as portfolio level, then switches are not relevant in the calculation. Also Read How to Use SIP CAGR Calculator to Estimate Returns on Mutual Fund Investments? Best Low-Risk Mutual Funds Example of XIRR Calculation in Excel Here is an example of a six-month SIP to calculate XIRR in mutual funds: SIP amount = Rs.5,000 SIP investment dates: Start on 01-01-2017, End on 01-06-2017 Date of redemption: 01-07-2017 Maturity sum = Rs.31,000 Let’s assume cash flows as mentioned in the table below: 01/01/2017 -5000 03/02/2017 -5000 01/03/2017 -5000 11/04/2017 -5000 01/05/2017 -5000 25/06/2017 -5000 01-07-2017 31000 XIRR 11.92429 Let’s take a look at the calculation part below: In the left column, all the dates are mentioned. The right column includes your SIP instalments of Rs.5,000. It is marked as negative owing to the outflow of cash. In the left column, you can find the redemption date. Just beside that, there is a redemption amount of Rs.31,000. Use the XIRR formula: Insert the range of cells that represent the transaction values. After that, enter the series of payment dates with respect to the value of the cash flows. You will have your XIRR value of 11.92 %, as mentioned in the table. Why is XIRR Accurate for Mutual Funds? Let us assume that you had started investing in a scheme via a monthly SIP of Rs.15,000 and then continued the investment for 5 years. Supposed, after 5 years, the value of the investment grew to Rs.12 lakh. Here, the annual return of the first month’s instalment will be different from the rest as it had remained invested for the maximum number of months. In simpler words, the CAGR of each instalment will differ as their investment period will be different. Analysing the performance of a mutual fund will become complicated when you look at the CAGRs of these instalments. To make the task easier, all the CAGRs are adjusted together to a common CAGR which is then considered as a mutual fund’s XIRR. XIRR vs CAGR – Can we use CAGR Instead of XIRR? This is a common misconception that CAGR and XIRR are the same. CAGR is the accurate calculation of returns on every instalment, which doesn’t take inflows and outflows into consideration. In contrast, XIRR means the overall average of the CAGRs and takes into account every inflow & outflow of cash. Here are some simplified pointers to make their differences obvious: XIRR CAGR XIRR meaning is an average annualised return. CAGR is the absolute annualised return. XIRR takes into account every cash inflow and outflow. CAGR is calculated only considering the initial value, absolute value and investment tenure. XIRR is calculated when there are multiple cash flows; hence, it can be good for SIP investments. CAGR is ideal for lump-sum investments . XIRR means an average of every return earned by each cash flow during tenure. CAGR is the compounded growth rate. Final Word XIRR is the most comprehensive way of determining your returns in case of multiple transactions, especially when your investment time is irregular. In other words, allocating your money to mutual funds via an SIP will lead to cash outflows and cash inflows. In such cases, the time of investment also plays a significant role in the calculation of the returns. To that end, the role of Extended Internal Rate of Return (XIRR) in SIP becomes essential.

If you wish to calculate XIRR in mutual funds, you need to enter all transactions and dates in corresponding columns in an MS Excel sheet. Then, you have to enter the following formula: “= XIRR (values, dates, guess). Cash outflows have to be entered as negative outflows and cash inflows as positive. What is the formula of CAGR? The formula for CAGR is as follows: CAGR ={(Ending balance/beginning balance)^1/n} – 1 Where, beginning balance = Investment value at the beginning of the investment period Ending balance = Investment value at the end of your investment N = Total number of years you have invested in a mutual fund What is IRR? IRR (Internal Rate of Return) is described as a discounting cash flow technique which provides the rate of return that a mutual fund has earned. Here, both the discounted cash inflow and the total initial cash outlay are equal to zero. Is XIRR better than IRR? IRR is used to determine returns against investments made at fixed intervals. But investments and redemptions are never regular. In that case, XIRR is the right choice. What is SIP in mutual funds? A SIP or Systematic Invest Plan is a tool to invest in mutual funds. It is a systematic way to invest a fixed sum of money in a periodical manner. It is also a very safe way to invest. What is XIRR in NPS or National Pension Scheme? Return on Investments for National Pension Scheme gives the annualised effective compounded return rate in the PRAN account and is calculated using the formula of XIRR. The calculation is done considering all the contribution/redemptions processed in the PRAN account since inception and the latest valuation of the investments. What is XIRR Return? XIRR Return is the returns on your mutual fund investments made at irregular intervals, like SIP investments. XIRR calculates the CAGR of every SIP investment made. These are then added together to give you the overall CAGR. Which is better – CAGR or XIRR? CAGR gives you the value of your annual return over a period of time longer than one year. But in the case of calculating returns on frequent investments or cash flows during different time periods, such a method is not apt as it does not consider multiple cash flows. In such cases, XIRR is an ideal option. Does the XIRR function work monthly in Excel? The XIRR function in MS Excel always computes an annualised IRR even if an individual calculates returns on weekly/monthly cash flows. What is XIRR Full Form? XIRR stands for Extended Internal Rate of Return. Before you go… Want to put your savings into action and kick-start your investment journey 💸 But don’t have time to do research?

       "'title: XIRR vs CAGR: Which is the right way to calculate mutual fund returns? | Mint. published_date: 2023-10-19T11:42:31+05:30. content:  Before you start investing in the mutual funds, you should ideally examine the past returns of all the schemes that you want to invest into. And since there are a number of ways to calculate the past returns, you should opt for the one that suits you the most. For instance, XIRR and CAGR are among the two most preferred parameters that are used to calculate the returns on various investment products including mutual fund returns. Most investors get confused as to which parameter should one go for. Why should one measure the return on investment on their mutual fund investment in the first place? To find this out we have to\\xa0explore XIRR and CAGR in detail to understand which method is the right way to calculate mutual fund returns. What is XIRR? XIRR\\xa0stands for extended internal rate of return. It is a method that is used to calculate the annualised return on investment when cash flows happen at irregular intervals. It takes into account all cash inflows and outflows, along with the dates on which they occur, to calculate the annual rate of return. XIRR considers the timing and amount of each cash flow, making it a more accurate method for investments with irregular cash flows. What is CAGR? CAGR\\xa0stands for\\xa0Compound Annual Growth Rate and is a method that is used to calculate the annualised return on investment when cash flows occur at regular intervals. It assumes a constant rate of growth over a specific period and calculates the average rate of return during that period. CAGR is useful for understanding the growth rate of an investment over time and is commonly used for long-term investments like mutual funds. XIRR vs CAGR XIRR is commonly used when evaluating mutual funds with irregular cash flows. This could be the case when an investor makes additional investments or withdrawals at different points in time. XIRR takes into account the timing and amount of each cash flow, providing a more accurate measure of the annualised return. It accounts for the compounding effect of investing or withdrawing funds at different periods, making it useful for comparing returns of funds with different investment patterns. CAGR, on the other hand, is commonly used when evaluating mutual funds with regular cash flows. It assumes a constant rate of growth over a specific period, making it ideal for comparing funds that have a consistent investment pattern. CAGR provides a simplified measure of the average annual return over a specified time period, making it useful for long-term investment analysis. Dev Ashish, a SEBI registered investment advisor, and Founder, StableInvestor , says, “ While CAGR can be used to calculate returns from lumpsum investment in mutual funds, it is advisable to use XIRR for calculating returns from periodic (non lump sum) investments like SIP. Suppose you invest ₹ 1 lakh lump sum in 2017. After 5 years, the value of this becomes ₹ 2 lakh in 2022. In this case we use CAGR to calculate returns from lumpsum investments. This comes to 14.87% CAGR.\" Mukesh Vijayvergia, Founder of Nishkaera Financial Advisory and Wealth Management, echoes the same sentiments. “While CAGR measures the annualised compounded return on investment for a certain period, assuming reinvestment of profits; XIRR measures the average return earned by the investor after factoring in periodic cash flows separately during the stipulated period,\" Vijayvergia says. Which one to choose? When it comes to calculating mutual fund returns, it is important to choose the method that suits the investment pattern and cash flow behaviour of the fund. If the fund has irregular cash flows, such as additional investments or withdrawals at different points in time, XIRR is the preferred method. It provides a more accurate measure of the annualised return, accounting for the timing and amount of each cash flow. On the other hand, if the fund has regular cash flows and a constant growth rate, CAGR is the preferred method. It gives a simplified measure of the average annual return over a specified time period, making it suitable for long-term investment analysis. In conclusion, XIRR and CAGR are both important tools for calculating returns on mutual funds, but they serve different purposes. XIRR is useful for investments with irregular cash flows, while CAGR is suitable for investments with regular cash flows. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each method, investors can make better-informed decisions and accurately calculate returns on their mutual funds. '"

       "\"The XIRR or Extended Internal Rate of Return is a method for calculating the return on mutual fund investments, especially those that involve irregular transactions, such as investments via a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). It serves as a way to understand the actual rate of return on investments that have varying cash flow timings, allowing you to compare your existing investments with potential alternatives. XIRR considers the timing of each cash outflow (like purchases and SIP instalments) and cash inflow (like dividends and redemptions), providing a more precise measurement of the annualized return than methods suited for regular intervals, such as CAGR.\\n\\nTo calculate XIRR, financial transactions and their corresponding dates are input into a formula in Microsoft Excel: `=XIRR(values, dates, [guess])`. In this formula, 'values' refer to the cash flows (negative for outflows, positive for inflows), 'dates' correspond to when the cash flows take place, and 'guess' is an optional estimate of the return rate, with a default of 10% if omitted.\\n\\nThis method is particularly useful for mutual fund investments made at different times and amounts, as it accurately reflects the complexities associated with such investments.\""

       "\"XIRR, which stands for Extended Internal Rate of Return, is a method for calculating the return on investment for transactions that do not occur at regular intervals, such as those in mutual funds through a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP). It allows for the consideration of each individual cash flow along with the specific dates they occur, which gives a more accurate annualized rate of return for investments with irregular cash flows. The XIRR function is available in Microsoft Excel and can accommodate cash flows (both inflows and outflows) of varying amounts and at different times. It is particularly useful when comparing returns of investments that have different patterns of cash flows, such as additional investments or withdrawals made at various points in time. The formula provided in Microsoft Excel for XIRR is “= XIRR (values, dates, [guess])”, where 'values' refer to an array of cash flows, 'dates' correspond to the series of dates when the cash flows occurred, and 'guess' is an optional argument for an initial estimate of the return rate. \\n\\nThis financial measure is deemed more accurate than CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) for scenarios with irregular investments or withdrawals because it accounts for the timing of each transaction.\""

       "'   The concept of reversing entropy is a part of the field of thermodynamics and is connected to the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamis founds on the concept that the entropy or the total energy of a system tends to increase over time. It is also linked with the concept of the flow of heat from a hot body to a cooler one. When heat flows from a hot body to a cooler one it is termed as heat transfer and it is a process that is naturally initiated and follows the path of the natural gradient of temperature. Heating and cooling are natural processes that happen naturally and entropy tends to increase naturally. However there are certain instances where entropy can be reversed. These are the cases when the natural flow of heat is interrupted or reversed through a suitable device. These devices are called Heat pumps. These are devices that can reverse the direction of the flow of heat. They can remove heat from a low-temperature body and transfer it to a higher-temperature body. These devices can also work in reverse and can pull heat from a cold body and transfer it to a hot body. The working of these devices is based on the concept of compressing and expanding of the working fluid. The working fluid is compressed and the work done during the compression is transferred to the working fluid. The work done on the working fluid results in raising the temperature of the working fluid. The heat is transferred to the working fluid from the external body. The heat transfer is happening from a low-temperature body to a higher-temperature body. The heat transfer is reversed if the working fluid is expanded and the work done during the expansion is transferred back to the working fluid. The working fluid then loses its energy and the transfer of energy occurs in the opposite direction from a low-temperature body to a higher-temperature body. The working fluid has to be compressed and expanded for the reversing of the flow of heat. Reversing the flow of heat is possible only through a suitable device like a Heat pump. There are certain conditions in which the flow of heat cannot be reversed. In such cases the concept of Entropy cannot be reversed. Entropy can only be reversed in the case of a Heat pump. \\n<|im_end|>'"
