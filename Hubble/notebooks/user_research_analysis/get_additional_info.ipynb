       "\"Acquisition\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved Wint Wealth Group’s acquisition of a majority stake in Chandigarh-based NBFC Ambium Finserve Pvt Ltd, Wint Wealth said in a release.\\n\\nWint Wealth Group is a wealth-tech conglomerate with a focus on fixed-income investments.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nPost-acquisition, the NBFC has already started its wholesale lending operations under the brand name Wint Capital, the release added.\\n\\nWint Capital’s current loan book is close to Rs 50 crore and is expected to grow to Rs 500 crore by the end of 2024, the release added.\\n\\n“The NBFC license will open many new avenues of innovation for us as we can now bring corporate bonds from Wint Capital to better address the needs of our retail investors,” said Ajinkya Kulkarni, Co-Founder and CEO of Wint Wealth.\\n\\nAs per the release, Wint Capital has raised Rs 8 crore in debt and Rs 63 crore in equity from institutional investors so far and will continue to explore meaningful deals to expand its loan book.\\n\\n“The NBFC also plans to bring its listed corporate bonds to retail investors early next year,” the release added.\\n\\nSo far, Wint Wealth Group enabled over 53,000 investors to invest in fixed deposits, corporate and sovereign gold bonds and bond baskets worth over Rs 1300 crore, it said.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Ajinkya_Kulkarni\\n\\nOnline bond platform Wint Wealth will offer Fincare Small Finance Bank’s fixed deposit product on its platform for retail investors, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder Ajinkya Kulkarni told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview on October 18.\\n\\nCurrently, the bond platform offers fixed deposits of Bajaj Finance, which are live on its website.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nKulkarni added that over the next 12 months, Wint Wealth will onboard all the small finance banks on its bond platform to widen the choice of fixed deposits and interest rates.\\n\\nAt the same time, he said, the company will still continue to offer high-quality corporate bonds, curated bond baskets, and sovereign gold bonds on its platform to help invest and create a diversified debt portfolio.\\n\\nEdited excerpts:\\n\\nWhat is your rationale for moving to FDs after starting with corporate bonds?\\n\\nWhen retail investors consider financial planning, fixed deposits invariably feature in their scheme of things. They have different use cases for everyone. For a young urban investor, a fixed deposit could be the way to park emergency funds or hold windfall gains to meet a short-term requirement. A family in a tier 2-3 town may opt for an FD to plan their children's education.\\n\\nAs per RBI data, the total market size of retail fixed deposits in the country was more than Rs 51 lakh crore as of June and growing at 7-8 percent per annum. Currently, the interest rates on FDs are at the highest level in the last 10 years. Thus, the time is ripe to build a product that empowers retail investors to book FDs easily and safely.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nNBFCs and small finance banks offer 1-2 percent interest arbitrage on FDs over their established banking peers. So, there is a very strong value proposition for retail investors. However, these NBFCs and small finance banks lack the digital infrastructure for distribution. We solve this problem by onboarding them on our platform and providing a seamless user experience.\\n\\nAlso read: MC exclusive: Centre plans OFS in defence, railway, fertiliser, coal PSUs to meet minimum public shareholding\\n\\nHow do you intend to make money selling FDs?\\n\\nWe will earn 50-100 basis points distribution commission from NBFCs and small finance banks. Being a mass product, we can build a sustainable revenue stream from FD distribution. Moreover, there are many opportunities to cross-sell other financial products to investors.\\n\\nHow has the business grown since SEBI introduced regulations for OBPPs last year?\\n\\nThe regulation has certainly improved the sense of trust among our investors. However, business growth has been moderate because the minimum face value of listed debt securities under private placement is still Rs 1 lakh. It means that to build a diversified bond portfolio, retail investors need a minimum of Rs 5-6 lakh. Not many retail investors can afford such hefty investments in corporate bonds.\\n\\nEarlier, the SEBI Chairman indicated that the ticket size would be reduced further. We are hopeful that it will be done soon. In the meantime, we are solving the diversification problem through our basket of bonds, which allows investors to invest in bonds from 7-8 NBFCs with Rs 1 lakh investment. Having said that, the OBPP industry cannot expect any meaningful growth before the ticket size is brought down substantially.\\n\\nAlso read: Bob World app case: A look at the issue and the regulatory action it triggered\\n\\nHow do you plan to shape the business from here on? Are there any other product lines that you intend to add?\\n\\nOur impetus is building Wint Wealth as the easiest and safest platform to book fixed deposits. Currently, investors can book Bajaj Finance FDs from our platform. By next week, we will also have FDs from Fincare Small Finance Bank on our platform.\\n\\nOver the next 12 months, we will onboard all the small finance banks on our platform to widen the choice of FDs with the best interest rates. At the same time, we will continue to identify and bring high-quality corporate bonds, curated bond baskets, and sovereign gold bonds on our platform to help invest and create a diversified debt portfolio.\\n\\nWhat is your outlook on funding for fintech startups? Any plans to raise Series B funding?\\n\\nApart from the ongoing funding winter, the fintech industry faces additional regulatory risks as well. So, until the regulations play out completely, investors will be cautious in taking new bets.\\n\\nWe have always been prudent in our operational expenditure and preferred growing organically as much as possible. We still have more funds in our bank account than we raised in the Series A round. Therefore, we are well capitalised for the next 3-4 years. We are targeting to be EBIDTA positive over the next 12-18 months. As of now, there are no plans to raise more capital. If there are any meaningful offers next year onwards, we will decide on a case-to-case basis. Wint Wealth, an alternative debt asset platform for retail investors, recently launched ‘Wint Bricks Nov21’ - a senior secured bonds issue from U GROW Capital (Ugrow), a non-banking financial company.\\n\\nThe bonds are offering an attractive 10.50 per cent (XIRR) for a little over a two-year tenure. You can invest as little as ₹10,000 which is a small ticket size for bond investments. The return is particularly enticing when seen in the context of the falling interest rates on bank fixed deposits.\\n\\nBut the higher returns obviously come with commensurate risk. Do your homework before you take the plunge. Here, we highlight the key points about this bond issue.\\n\\nWhat bonds are on offer\\n\\nCo-founded in November 2019 by two financial services industry professionals, Wint Wealth (earlier GrowFix) is a fixed income investment platform for retail investors. Excluding the latest offering, Wint Bricks Nov21, the platform has so far offered seven bond issues totalling ₹100 crore.\\n\\nThe latest one, Wint Bricks Nov21 is a ₹50 crore senior secured bond issue from Ugrow, an NBFC focused on lending to small businesses (more details later). These bonds have been bought by Wint Wealth and other wholesale buyers (or warehousing partners, as they are called) from Ugrow in a primary issue and are now being made available for sale to retail investors on the Wint Wealth platform.\\n\\nThe bonds mature in 27 months and are offering a return (XIRR or extended internal rate of return) of 10.50 per cent. Investors will receive monthly interest on the bonds and will be repaid 33 per cent of their principal every 9 months (see table for details). That one doesn’t have to wait until maturity to receive the entire principal is a positive on the risk front.\\n\\nThough, as part principal repayments are made, the monthly interest income is bound to go down.\\n\\nUsually investment returns are indicated in the form of CAGR (compound annual growth rate). But, in case of investments involving multiple inflows / outflows (periodic interest and principal repayment in the case of the Ugrow bonds) at different times throughout the investment period, XIRR and not CAGR provides the correct return calculation.\\n\\nThe Ugrow bonds are ‘senior secured’ which essentially means that they are secured by way of collateral (assets) on which the bondholders have exclusive charge. In this case, the Rs. 50 crore issue has been collateralized by ₹62.5 crore worth of property loans. The bonds are rated A (Positive) by Acuite Ratings.\\n\\nAny individual with a demat account can buy these bonds either on the Wint Wealth platform or directly through their brokerage account. Even when you invest via the platform, the order is still placed through the broker and executed on the exchange. Note that, there is a temporary halt in the sale of these bonds and these are expected to be available for sale from December 1. These bonds are listed on the BSE and the NSE. Investors are not charged for transactions on the platform.\\n\\nWhile the returns are enticing and buying the bonds too appears easy, let these not be the deciding factors for investing in them.\\n\\nAlso read: Nuts and bolts of Retail Direct Gilt account\\n\\nMultiple risks\\n\\nWhile the bond issue is backed by adequate collateral, the issue has a relatively low credit rating of A from Acuite Ratings and calls for caution. The highest-rated safest bonds are assigned a AAA rating.\\n\\nUgrow is a relatively new NBFC specializing in SME lending that began loan disbursements only in January 2019. It had assets under management of only ₹1,933 crore as of September 2021. Sector-wise, light engineering and food processing alone account for 40 per cent of its loan book. While the company’s net NPA (non-performing assets) of 1.8 per cent appears low, this is likely reflecting the impact of loan restructuring (7.2 per cent of its portfolio) undertaken by it in the September 2021 quarter.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the collateral, what matters is how liquid it is. In this case, the issue is backed by Ugrow’s property loans. As long as the majority of the borrowers keep servicing their loans, the collateral (property loans) can offer support in the event of any default on the bonds. But, if there were to be a spike in loan defaults, then even though the underlying property can be confiscated, liquidating it to pay off the bondholders can turn out to be a time-consuming process.\\n\\nAlso, while it may be easy to buy the Ugrow bonds now, selling them before maturity may not so, due to lack of sufficient buyers. So, one must be prepared to hold these bonds until maturity.\""

       "\"Opportunities are what helps humanity unlock true potential, but it gets challenging if it's only accessible to a few. We believe everyone should have access to opportunities that are only available to some. So we took a first step towards building a process that makes unique assets accessible to everyone for investment with a remarkably lower ticket size. Some said we were crazy to think everyone will understand these advanced assets. So, we centred our aim towards education and transparency. You'll be surprised to see that the risks are mentioned alongside the fixed returns because we don't sell. We feel we are doing something meaningful and right because here you are. At Wint Wealth, we make sure that you know about the assets as much as we do because you are the one who knows what's better for you. Zerodha-backed startup Wint Wealth is offering covered bonds structure for retail investors, offering 9-11% returns at ticket sizes starting from as low as Rs 10,000. Wint Wealth is an alternative investment platform democratising debt investment options for retail investors. In an interaction with FE Online, Wint Wealth co-founder Ajinkya Kulkarni said, “For retail investors investment options have either been low-risk low-return Fixed Deposits or high-risk high-return equity exposure, moderate-risk moderate-return were always out of reach because of high ticket sizes, Wint Wealth is changing that by democratizing one asset structure at a time.”\\n\\nCurrently, the company is focussing on educating more investors about what Wint Wealth is doing, who can invest in what it offers, and why they should consider investing.\\n\\n“At Wint, we are on a mission to unlock debt investment opportunities for retail investors considering portfolio diversification. Our services are catered towards enabling individual investors enter the debt landscape, previously exclusive only to HNIs and UHNIs, with a ticket size as low as Rs. 10,000. While industry share of alternative assets is $10 Trillion, India accounts for $19 Billion of alternative asset/debt investment share. The potential to invest in alternative assets is huge and the platform is expected to reach Rs 500 Crore AUM by end of the year and Rs 10,000 crores worth of assets by 2024. We hope to make debt investing easy and accessible to Indian investors (retail. HNIs) across the breadth of the country,” said Ajinkya.\\n\\nAlso Read 7th Pay Commission: DA hike announced in early March, but why some employees and pensioners await revised pay and arrears? Mutual Fund Investment: How to determine the ideal SIP amount for investing in FY2024-25 Teach Them Young: The best time and ways to start teaching kids about money Unable to get a loan? Follow these tips to enhance your loan eligibility\\n\\nIs Wint Wealth different from competitors?\\n\\nAjinkya said Wint’s aim is to be an investor-centric and transparent company in the alternate investment space. “We advise and educate investors to diversify their portfolio and not just limit themselves to investing with us rather have a well balanced portfolio. We want people to understand the risk-return profile of the investment and put 10-15% of their overall portfolio eventually in Wint Wealth assets,” he said.\\n\\n“We have taken a route of one guided by regulations, assets we provide are listed on the exchange and thus, rated by the rating agencies with the end units actually transferred to the investors Demat account providing the much-needed transparency for investors who are putting their hard-earned money in the structures we provide,” Azinkya added.\\n\\nTraditionally, Debt Investments was initially only available to the Ultra HNIs as the ticket size was between Rs. 50 lakh to 1 crore. Wint Wealth is trying to democratize fixed-income assets for retail investors who can enter the debt landscape with a ticket size as low as Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nSkin in the game\\n\\nAjinkya is happy about the skin-in-the-game rule announced recently by SEBI. As per the rule, key employees of a mutual fund company will receive 20 per cent salary as fund units. These units will be locked in for three years. He said it is a noteworthy move as it creates skin in the game for people operating the funds.\\n\\nBecause of the new SEBI decision, now if the fund manager has a salary of Rs 1 crore, his/her Rs 20 lakh will be in the schemes they run. Consequently, if the fund underperforms, the fund manager will suffer a personal downside. While if it overperforms, he/she will get rewarded.\\n\\n“The reputation of the fund is always at stake. But when the people operating the fund are investing in the same funds, they have skin in the game – not just financially but also emotionally. If the fund drops 5-10% in value, the fund operator feels emotional pain that drives his/ her decision-making in a true sense. It aligns funds’ and investor’s interests together. In fact, at Wint Wealth, all our team members invest in every asset. Wint Wealth, as an organization, holds 2% of every asset until its maturity,” he said. Wint Wealth has become widely popular with Indian investors. It provides access to a high-yield asset class that was only available to High Net Worth individuals till now. It is a significant step to democratize alternative investments in India and provide diversification opportunities to investors. In this Wint Wealth Review, let us understand the platform in-depth and how you can generate up to 11-12% yield with lesser risks.\\n\\nWhat are Bonds\\n\\nBonds are akin to fixed assets. Bonds, which are financial securities, represent money the issuers owe to their buyers, and the issuer repays the principal amount on maturity and interest until it matures. Majorly, bonds can be of two types:\\n\\nUnsecured Bonds: Unsecured bonds do not include any collateral in the agreement. Let’s say that if the company stops operating or becomes bankrupt, you have fewer chances of recovering your initial investment. Secured Bonds: On the other hand, a secured bond is backed by sufficient collateral. That means if the company stops operating or goes bankrupt, you have the security of getting your investment back.\\n\\nDifferent Types of Bonds\\n\\nBased on the Issuer\\n\\nGovernment Securities\\n\\nThey are also known as G- Secs and are issued by the Central Government to borrow public funds for the country’s development, and they are one of the safest bonds.\\n\\nCorporate Bonds\\n\\nPrivate companies issue these bonds to raise capital to grow, and they offer higher interest rates than G- Secs but also have a higher risk.\\n\\nPublic Sector Bonds\\n\\nPublic Sector Undertakings are issued. These bonds are known as public-sector bonds. These are the companies owned and managed by the government.\\n\\nState Development Loans (SDLs)\\n\\nThe state government issues these bonds to raise funds for the development of the state. The credit risk is lower in these bonds.\\n\\nSovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)\\n\\nSovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) are bonds backed by assets and are issued by the Central Government. These bonds are denominated in gold, each worth one gram of gold. Investing in gold is an excellent option if you do not want to hold gold physically.\\n\\nTypes of Bonds Based on Nature and Frequency of Interest Payments\\n\\nFixed Rate Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds offer fixed interest rates, pre-determined and paid in regular intervals, which can be annual, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly.\\n\\nFloating Rate Bonds\\n\\nAs the name suggests, the interest rates do not remain fixed in the bond tenure and keep fluctuating depending on a selected benchmark interest rate.\\n\\nZero-Coupon Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds do not provide interest but are issued at a discount of their face value, and while they are matured, they are redeemed at their face value.\\n\\nPerpetual Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds generally take the form of subordinated debt and can also be called because they do not have a maturity date. Still, they pay the pre-determined interest rate to the investor throughout the holding period of the bond.\\n\\n5. Senior Secured Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds get priority rights of getting the payments as compared to the subordinated bonds and loans. Moreover, these bonds have some collateral with them such as property, receivables etc. which could be used in the recovery case of default by the issuer. Investing in Wint Wealth’s Senior Secured Bonds can be a good option if you seek stable returns and a higher level of security than unsecured bonds. In simple words, senior secured bonds mean that if the company goes bankrupt, the senior secured bondholders will have the highest priority and be paid back first.\\n\\nWhat is Wint Wealth?\\n\\nResolution of default is a long and tedious process with a lot of legalities. Each lender is fighting to get their money back which can take years, and in many cases, some processes get stuck in fraud investigation. This is evident from some of the latest defaults like ILFS, DHFL, and Sintex.\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since the ILFS default. Lenders are clueless about how much more time will it take and what will they get after that! To make it worse some of the investors with deep pockets want to get preferential treatment in asset monetization proceedings. Wint Wealth is able to sidestep these problems by creating exclusive collateral for investors using products like Covered Bonds and Senior Secured Bonds.\\n\\nRegister for Free on Wint Wealth\\n\\nWhat is the Wint Wealth Business Model?\\n\\nWint Wealth is a fintech platform that works closely with companies that are looking to raise money. They allow retail investors to invest in innovative products to provide lending to those companies. These products have a lower risk compared to unsecured bonds.\\n\\nTraditionally, these investments were only available to the Ultra HNIs with a ticket size between Rs. 50L to 1Cr. With their high-rated asset-backed debt products, they aim to democratize fixed-income assets for retail investors to enter the debt landscape with a ticket size as low as Rs. 10,000. This helps first-time debt investors to diversify their investments toward debt.\\n\\nWint Wealth has introduced senior secured Bonds/covered bonds for retail investors which provide enhanced security. Wint Wealth products are created to provide\\n\\nFixed/ steady returns (9-12%). Physical collateral like gold, real estate, or vehicles used as collateral Bankruptcy protected framework Low Minimum Investments\\n\\nThe normal cash flow of the Issuer will service the interest payment under business-as-usual circumstances.\\n\\nCashflow from the collateral pool (gold loans, property loans, etc) will be utilized for payment if predefined trigger events occur (eg delay in interest payment)\\n\\nBased on predefined investment criteria (until the start of the principal amortization), the cash flow from the pool will be used to acquire additional loan assets from the issuer so that collateral cover is always present\\n\\nFD is required in some cases for additional collateral\\n\\nWhy Wintwealth?\\n\\nTypically, these kinds of bonds have a very high ticket size, and individual investors cannot invest in these instruments as the minimum investment is INR 10 lakhs.\\n\\nAnother way to invest in these bonds is through mutual funds where the mutual funds invest in these funds but it include their margins and costs. As the tax benefit of these mutual funds has been revoked by the finance ministry bonds have become more attractive.\\n\\nBut all these problems are solved by Wint, as it allows retail investors to invest in these instruments for as low as INR 10,000. You can directly invest in these bonds without intermediaries, which results in higher returns for the investors.\\n\\nWhat are the Features of Wint Wealth?\\n\\nStable Returns: Investing in bonds provides stable returns over time, which is impossible in the stock market. The stock market is known for its unpredictable nature with both significant gains and losses hence investing all your funds in the stock market can be risky. Diversifying some of your funds for fixed returns is an excellent choice for your portfolio as it prevents you from market volatility. Higher Returns than Fixed Deposits: Investing in bonds provide you with 9-11% returns on average which is higher than Fixed Deposits. Secured Investment: Due to multiple instances of financial fraud in the industry, many buyers hesitate to invest directly. Wint Wealth addresses this issue by carefully selecting the most secure investment options from the top businesses, which ensures safe investment. Small Investment Amount: Wint Wealth enables you to participate in fixed-income securities for as low as Rs. 10,000, significantly lower than traditional bond investments. This means you do not need to make significant investments to invest in these assets.\\n\\nWint Wealth Founding Team\\n\\nWint Wealth founder Ajinkya Kulkarni got together with 3 other individuals to start this company. The founders come with a diverse background in growing digital businesses and a deep understanding of Credit Risk.\\n\\nAjinkya and Abhik are experts in digital business models in the lending and payment space. Shashank has expertise in the technological aspects of the platforms to enhance user experience.\\n\\nThey roped in Anshul Gupta, the 4th founder from Northern Arc which is a pioneer in underwriting innovative credit products which have high yield and robust risk mitigation features.\\n\\nBenefits of Wint Wealth\\n\\nGood Returns: The investment options on Wint Wealth offers you around 9-11% returns on their Senior Secured Bonds, which is a good return in the category of fixed return security. Short Duration: Typically, bonds come with a lock-in period of around 5-8 years, but with Wint Wealth, you can invest for a short term of as low as two years. Listed on the Stock Market: The bonds on Wint Wealth’s platform are listed on the stock market, providing liquidity for the instruments. Fully Regulated: Wint Wealth is regulated by SEBI and RBI, making it a safe and secure platform for investors. Diversification: Investing in bonds allows you to diversify your portfolio and reduce the risk of stock market fluctuations.\\n\\nWint Wealth and Zerodha Connection\\n\\nWint Wealth raised $2Mn in seed funding from high-profile investors. It includes Zerodha, Kunal Shah, and Wazirx founder Nischal Shetty. Wint Wealth funding by Zerodha is through their Rain Matter Fund.\\n\\nRainmatter is a subsidiary of Zerodha. The Bangalore-based incubator provides well-equipped workspaces, mentorship, and funding ($100K-$1M) to innovative startups in the capital markets space in exchange for minority stakes.\\n\\nThey have further received USD 15 Mn led by Eight Road Ventures in May 2022\\n\\nIs Wint Wealth Safe?\\n\\nThere are two aspects of safety in the parlance of investment platforms\\n\\nGenuinity of the platform\\n\\nDeals available on the platform\\n\\nThere is sufficient evidence to suggest the platform is trustworthy and acts in the interest of Investors. It is backed by credible people. The platform takes sufficient steps to educate investors on the deals it introduces for investment\\n\\nThe safety of the deals available on Wint Wealth has to be considered by comparing the products offering similar returns. All future deals on Wint Wealth will be public issues which means they are regulated by SEBI and the platform needs to follow the requisite protocols. Secondly, the assets have an extra layer of security compared to similar NCDs available on the secondary market because of the covered bond feature!\\n\\nRegister for Free on Wint Wealth\\n\\nWint Wealth Risk\\n\\nCredit Risk: In many cases, investors have a fear of their investments becoming worthless if a company fails because there are many cases where unsecured bonds have resulted in huge losses for the investors. But this risk is eliminated by Wint Wealth by listing companies only that have sufficient assets to cover their raised funds. In addition, the platform also offers Amortising Bonds that allow you to retrieve your principal amount in installments over a specific period, further reducing the risk of loss. Risk of Fraud: With the increase in cyber crimes, predicting the chances of fraud is daunting; hence, investors are not very confident with these investment options. But Wint Wealth ensures the complete safety of bonds by selecting and curating the bonds carefully by the experts. Risk of Liquidity: You can invest in bonds whenever they are available. However, you might need help selling them because many bonds do not have liquidity, even if they are listed on the stock exchanges. To reduce the risk, you should invest only the amount you can hold for a fixed period. Wint Wealth offers short-term bonds with a maturity of one to two years with good returns.\\n\\nWintwealth Fees\\n\\nWintwealth does not charge any fees to the investor. The fees are borne by the issuer and hence the return shown to you by the platform are the actual returns available to you as an investor.\\n\\nWint Wealth Vs Golden Pi: A Comparison\\n\\nGoldenPi is another platform backed by Zerodha that allows investors to buy fixed-income securities. Some of the differences between Wint Wealth and Golden Pi are:\\n\\nTicket Size: Golden Pi has most bonds with a minimum investment requirement of INR 10 Lakh which can be high for most investors whereas you can start with INR 10k on Wintwealth Diversification: Wint Wealth allows more diversification as you can create a more granular portfolio using smaller allocations to each bond. Selection of Bonds: You select from bonds based on your risk appetite on Golden Pi, which ranges from high- security with fewer returns to high returns with less security. However, in Wint Wealth, safety and reducing risks in bonds are what the customers look for. Hence the returns remain constant at 9-11% with better security.\\n\\nHow is Wint Wealth Taxed?\\n\\nAll bonds will be taxed as per your income slab hence it makes more sense to invest from an account that is under a lower tax bracket to reduce outgo.\\n\\nHow does Wint Wealth Make Money?\\n\\nWint Wealth charges a percentage of the bonds listed on the websites, the users are not charged, but the Issuers are charged for listing.\\n\\nWint Wealth- 2 Years of Experience\\n\\nMy investment experience with Wint Wealth was smooth. The platform is user-friendly, and a return of at least 9-11% can be expected with limited risk. I have invested in more than 7 opportunities listed on Wintwealth over the last 2 years.\\n\\nSome of the bonds I invested in were\\n\\nOxyzo\\n\\nSlice\\n\\nAryadhan\\n\\nIIFL\\n\\nWint Wealth Sovereign Gold Bonds\\n\\nWint Wealth has a great feature that allows you to buy sovereign gold bonds at a steep discount from Face value. The reason for that is many times these listed bonds are trading at a discount due to selling by other investors.\\n\\nA sovereign gold bond is one of the best products for investing in gold as it is backed by the government. You get additional 2.5% fixed returns and the capital gains are tax-free at maturity. I use Wint for purchasing Sovereign Gold Bond whenever gold value drops to average my returns.\\n\\nWint Wealth Alternatives\\n\\nThere are many platforms that can be used to complement Wint Wealth. Grip Invest is one platform that provides access to Bonds and Leasing Investment and provided 20-21% IRR. Another Wint Wealth Alternative is TradeCred which is a marketplace for Invoice Discounting.\\n\\nPeople can also explore Klubworks for revenue-based Financing. Lendbox and Leafround have also come up with interesting products with stable returns and low risk.\\n\\nTo get more exposure to other opportunities in High Yield Debt you can explore Jiraaf.

So now enjoying my retired life as well as retirement brings a lot of financial management discipline also into picture. Naturally the financial management person has to be wise once he gets into I mean when we are working we don't have any time. So now I know that the money is not coming.  some good videos that's all thank thank you sir and congratulations on your retired life money sir if you can go next your hobbies your passions yes hello everyone nice to meet with you so myself Manish from Jaipur and I run a software company I started very early so my my goal is to get retired early like someone is retired  lot of books and basically this is it. Thank you Manish sir. And Deet sir if you can just give us a short intro about yourself and what are your hobbies, what are your passions? Yeah, hi Kapil. Happy to see you and happy to connect with you. Actually myself, Ranjit, I have five plus years of experience in digital marketing  aspects like if I am going for any short-term investment that kind of thing wind will be very much lucrative asset for me because suppose if based on my thoughts I am like how to use this event well suppose if I have like every year like health insurance that kind of thing health as well as some other like  your hobbies your passions uh it's great to know about your financial yeah my hobbies were playing cricket as well as badminton and i like to swim uh like i'm i'm very much interested in this is my habit thank you thank you sir if you can please help me with your hobbies your passions hi hey everyone so this is i 28 uh i work with an mnc company  for an automotive firm. It's Mercedes-Benz. I work on autonomous driving. Apparently, I've been also into investing since 2016. I'm currently 27 years old. So I use WintWealth majorly as a diversification platform. That's my major intent of using this because most of them are linked to equity and I want to somehow move out from that. So I've been also using a couple of other websites as well, just part of diversification. But then my major hobbies would be related to finding what's the new problem to solve in the world of startups.  are you aware of and where do you invest in general? Okay. Should I say? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an open forum for everyone. Yeah. So basically I invest like, you know, of course, making my portfolio very much balanced in like, you know, equity, real estate, of course, gold. So for real estate,  I invest via small cases as well. And for that portion, of course, bond is one of the thing other than that, you know, I invest in some other debt way, you know, mutual funds. And again, some, I would say some part of still liquid fund and FDs for, you know, for opportunistic way and some kind of emergency kind of thing. And so I believe equity and then debt  money to the equity side more so I am doing that. Okay. Nice to hear that. Yeah, Alok sir. You can just go ahead. So as I told I am leading a retired life and besides searching for a job the prudence calls that whatever terminal benefits I have got they are prudently invested and I have a sustained income that's my purpose. So  startup ecosystem and I believe that the startups promoted by young entrepreneurs they are there to do business and they are there to make a sustainable proposition for themselves as well as the stakeholders that is how I have reposed my faith in your products and I have liked the products and  One thing which I have to suggest, second thing what I have to suggest is that having repulsed our faith, my only request to you would be that to ensure that our payments and repayments are safe. Yes, sir. The way you can assure, it's all investors, not IKS only. Right. Like when you launch a product, it's very good. You host a video conferencing, you bring  very good faith yeah alok sir i will definitely take that in account but right now i just want to understand more about your investment behavior where do you invest in i'll definitely come back to wind and your suggestions for us and any areas where we are lacking but to improve ourselves but i want to kind of first understand more about you more about your investment behavior where do you invest in what products are you aware of so that you know we can  MIS. Right. So those are the kind of, I mean, it's a diversified statement. Right. And if I'm getting the new products, yes, I am trying with caution. And it's only once you start getting confidence built up, you will start investing in other products. So that's how it is going. My only, again, one more suggestion is the post office services have improved  as well as investing is important. I started my investing journey at 2020. In that scenario, first of all, I learned about how many types of investing assets we have. I didn't spend much on investing, but I tested multiple assets. If it is suitable for best asset, then I can go to that asset.  First, I will go for equity. Then I will go for liquid funds. Then I will go for mutual funds as well as bonds and bond scenario also. Some corporate bonds as well as wind wealth is coming into another type of bond. And then I'll slowly go for mutual funds. In the mutual funds also, small, medium and large scale. And which is suitable for me for long term as well as medium as well as small.  get to that space also. Right. Yeah. And type like one of the startup is there. I go for type also because for testing, if it is, if it is clicks for us, definitely we can more go for that scenario. Okay. Okay. Thank, thank you, sir. You have such a wide portfolio with covers. My portfolio. Yeah. My portfolio is not that much.  happened was roughly in 2020 there was a lot of products that came up in the market which we couldn't access in the past so for example startup investments were something that I was always interested in but the ticket size was very high which I for sure a normal working candidate could not put in such huge funds and then somehow I also was invested and I'm also still investing in Grip so Grip has three products which I'm actively invested in one is invoice discounting one is also startup equity so there's one investment that I recently made  as peer-to-peer lending. I've heard Bharatpay also has one, but I've not been invested in Bharatpay. But CRED is something that I'm actively putting some money every month as an SIP so that I expect about 9% returns. In case the market goes southwards, at least this hopefully gives you a little bit of return. But then these products like CRED or those sort where there is peer-to-peer lending, I do not want to be invested in for more than, let's say, two years or two or three years. I'm not that... At the moment,  So invested in mutual funds, equity, debt as well. And obviously invest primarily into the stock market as we're using small cases. And sometimes, you know, friends, et cetera, for lack of better term, right? You get to know this is going to do well. So sometimes you do that because, you know, it's one of them. Either it's going to make money or, you know, you trust your people. Then it's like that, right? So that's the first part of, you know, standardized sort of investing per se. The next one is more safer options, right?  well that give you returns on top of uh you know the cryptos that you're vested with them etc right so right that's the other other spectrum that i have invested in obviously and that's the length and breadth but what becomes very crucial is tracking these investments so uh i mean currently that's the that's the toughest part i mean right you you invested so many places right across so many platforms right so i use kuvera i don't know if you're aware of it  like a monthly SIP or a monthly bond system which you have in place. So what are the various things that which are your things which you look in? Like I'll give an example. When I look into e-commerce, I look in product quality, next day delivery, brand name. So when you invest in some things, what do you look in and what is like very critical for you? So for me, next day delivery is very critical. So I want to understand what do you look and what is very critical for you? To be honest, I think it's more about the allocation of cash  You talk with friends and get a bunch of list of, you know, which are the mutual funds you think are going to be doing well. You compile a list and then you do multiple SIPs in that during the month itself. I mean, it's not only that, you know, you invest once you, I mean, throughout the month also, if you think that the stock market has sort of gone down, if there's something that's happening, some event that's happening, the stock, I mean, last couple of months when the market sort of hit some lows, right? At that time, June or something like that.  buy low, etc. But when you look at the mutual funds one, what you're trying to look at is what's been there in general performance and how do they perform when the market goes down. I mean, that's one of the parameters that I look at. The same thing goes with small case also. I think they give you that backtesting and those graphs as well. So you can just move those around very basic. I don't do a structured analysis, but you can understand that if the market is falling or the index is falling by this much, what is the net-net impact usually on this and how much they rebalance.  critical and if that is not what something you have confidence with you don't at all invest in it see i i mean i don't do short term i mean short term investing is the stock funds that you invest in equity right but apart from that mutual funds i am i'm hopefully investing for the long term i mean i don't have any liabilities i don't have to uh do any immediate spending per se so my thing is that you know gonna be keep gonna keep on investing in them for the long run as  When you look at your financial planning, of course, that is the first homework everyone should be doing. So, you know, what are your goals and, you know, what actually you want to reach, where you want to reach. And then you decide a vehicle, you know, like, you know, I want to go this and I want to achieve this amount. So, this is the path. Yeah. So, it is a short-term thing. It is a long-term thing. So, based on that, you know, you pick one thing. Like, for example, small case is something for long-term. Equity is something for long-term. But, of course, there are mutual funds that I have picked for,  So I'm just compounding. So basically when I decide a product before the financial planning is important. And whenever I pick, like for example, how I research Wintwell. So I first do, you know, like the way you guys already doing, you know, showing interviews and everything, you know, making sure that the product is safe in some regards. So, you know, and then I started with very small step.  you know, like for example, I, I hear, I also want to mention Strata where I'm doing my real estate investment and their software, the web panel that they have designed. It's so intuitive and very, very like recently they've even launched the mobile app. So that's where, uh, went well, uh, have launched their mobile app, but that's only for Android right now, not iPhone users. So I'm waiting for that. So basically that makes your life easy, you know, because you feel connected and, uh, you know, you can, uh, you can see your investment whenever,  how I'm tracking it, what kind of reports and what kind of updates I'm getting. Then the customer support. Again, I really feel that customer support is very important because you sometimes have queries and you want to get sorted out. For example, recently when I got one of the investment get returned and the amount was the principal and interest was clubbed together.  in your bank statement. So it makes easier your life. This is the interest and this is the principle that you get. So that makes your life easy. Why? Because you have so many entries in your bank statement and sometimes it was easy to track. So basically these kind of stuff. So again, to summarize, product is based on the financial planning. I can't say that differs from person to person. But once you know the product and you want to invest, I prefer to start with small.  if you have anything to add to it and what do you look for and what is very critical for you? So, as I said that my prime investment is to secure a sustained income. So, any product which can bring sustained income and can be reassuring to the investor. I mean, it's like if I am able to  objective also. Yes, sir. Whatever income generation can be there, sustained income generation, any variation of the product will be there. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ranjit, sir, would you like to add something? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I've seen Vintual these testing with different assets, like they are repaying like three months, six months, one year.  uh uh origin is a big like three to five years you can increase the origin if we get the interest we can add some money and we can like again invest into this small little bit of asset classes that will be useful because we are recurring investment in the interval if you have some large large ticket of asset when we can invest that asset and we can get the repayment for every month we can add some amount and we can  if it is withdrawable at least within six months of span at least a part of the fund uh i will for sure be on it and that's why in my portfolio i keep uh those elss part a little lower than the the liquid ones so and hence wind has also given me that opportunity because you could take some part out every six months and then this also helps you to go a little more on your investment value because when you have liquidity you could put a little more in and then second thing is the tool itself for example  you so you know gold bonds you know mutual funds you know bonds in general so let's uh personify them like uh if i meet you for the first time how would uh you introduce them to me as friends uh for example uh like equity i had a gentleman saying that oh he's like a fun rock star i don't trust him but he's my friend for a long time and he's just like ranveer singh he dresses flashy and for  Yeah, bonds are like elder brother that kind of thing. Because he's guiding and he can care about like survey as well as any backups in there, they are ready to support us. That's kind of, you know, bonds are related to, it's like a brother kind of thing. Okay, and equity mutual funds and gold bonds, how would you say both of them? Equity kind of thing, you need,  gold bonds and bonds in general like these two people I think say you're on mute so I was saying gold and gold bonds and bonds you know gold bonds basically I'm more like SGB friend so SGBs and bonds are kind of you know kind of I would say test matches so you just believe they are good you know  monthly rebalance kind of. So you just sit aside and, you know, enjoying your small cases, how they are doing it, you know, and they're really doing great. Kind of. Yeah. So small case is your friend that you kind of have, you sit with him on a weekend, have long conversations. Right. And how is Gold Bond as your friend and how different is he from Bond in general? Like an SGB different from a Bond in general? That's a very big difference. Bond is like, you know,  nowadays SGB is also giving you interest so that's again a different way of getting meditation sort of and gold bond is again I will I feel like you know wind wealth till now the journey has been very very short so but till now I am really enjoying it so I would say I feel safe and again it's kind of where there is no kind of fluctuation lot of fluctuations and kind of you are kind of a  a friend with you, you are kind of excited. That gives an excitement that, you know, chilling in a more different way. Yeah. Ashwin, sir, you can, you want to add anything now or you would still kind of pass it off? I mean, as everyone mentioned, equity is more like those friends who, you know, quite, how would I say it?  Okay. Thanks, Ashwin. Aditya, anything you want to ask? Yeah, I wanted to ask you. I mean, I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but I recently read that news on, I don't know if you saw the hit piece on The Ken, right? And I was a bit shaken by that. Did you see the hit piece that Ken has written on Mint Wealth? Or no? Maybe I'll find you guys later. I will definitely check that out. And that was a bit discerning.  are like financial rock stars. So like half of my work is done there. But I would want to understand your opinions and your needs and how these assets are for you. So just give me a moment and let me know if my screen is visible. Siddharth, is my screen visible?  I have a few assets here. One is your sovereign gold bonds, which you guys have, which I think Manish sir has already mentioned about. Then debt mutual funds, which all of you are kind of aware about. Then tax-free bonds and FD aggregation and arbitrage funds. So there's a brief description on it. What kind of interest and returns you would expect? What are the taxation policies around it? What are the risk and loss?  you you  I think Ashwin is good to go. Aditya sir, Manish sir. Aditya sir, Manish sir, is everything good to go? Yeah, yeah. Okay.  I accept tax-free bonds. I believe I have every investment type. I have arbitrage bonds. I do have FDs. I do have debt mutual fund and I do have SGBs. But your rank one, like your... One, okay, okay. Because, you know, every investment have a different purpose. Like, for example, arbitrage fund, you know, for like, you know, I have park money for, you know, the money that I do need for next couple of years for at least one or two years.  I would say in terms of returns, because that is one of the parameters that everyone sees. So I would go with Dapp Mutual Fund, number one, because that's again a good thing and I feel that gives a good return. Again, not for short term. You need some kind of three years horizon at least. I will just spark you up on second right now. I just want to kind of get your opinion on the first one. I'll definitely come back to you.  would reduce down to more stable like tax-free bonds or FD aggregation. And Ajit, these are your thoughts, your number one pick. To be honest, currently I only invest in debt mutual funds for now. I mean, I don't understand what FD aggregation is. If it just means FDs, then yes, I do that as well. But I don't do this with 5 lakh government guarantee. I don't know how this is happening. But yeah, I mean, the one I would go with right now  I can't say no to arbitrage funds, but I haven't gotten around to parking money in them yet, to be honest. But the other ones are very, very, very long term. I feel the tax-free bonds and sovereign bond, the sovereign gold bonds, maybe if there's another crisis globally, then I'll put money in them. Not right now, yeah. Yeah, and Ashwin sir, like other good-to-have kind of a product and one you would say that it's like, okay, it's a good-to-have  like any particular thing? Somehow the whole concept is somehow doesn't look fascinating to me at the first place. I understand it's a rare earth metal which has some value at the moment and people are trading that rare earth metal for a long time. But somehow I cannot connect with sovereign gold bonds for some reason. No justifications as such. No, no, no. I just wanted your opinion around it. Money is,  these two not other three because you know they are not really again they all FDs of course not an investment according to me that's just for parking money for a certain emergency sort of thing and tax refunds again no low return so I would go with some other class other asset class so I will I haven't done and I am not exploring that and arbitrage fund again that was again a parking thing which is you know I have a very specific goal that is why I am using that but if I do  like five, six of these products on one single platform. Do you think your life would become easier if, you know, kind of things would be easier for you? What would be our expectations around it? Sure, of course, if everything, like, you know, for example, arbitrage funds already are on, you know, basically a type of mutual fund. So, arbitrage fund is already, like, you know, someone is already investing money on a particular, because nowadays everyone is utilizing,  where they already have money available. I'm not talking about corporate FDs. I'm talking about bank FDs right now. Tax-free bonds, again, of course, yes, tax-free bonds make sense because there is no ideal place available right now. Of course, they are, I think, one of the platforms from Zerodha provides a platform for having one platform for all kinds of bonds. But the only platform I know. Debt mutual fund, the same story like arbitrage fund. Again, if I'm already connected with and I'm doing my direct  using uh uh uh zerodha for that okay and and how's your experience been so far considering it's very easy like you know like buying a stock uh buying any stock you know you just go and pick the sgps of course i'm using some calculators available on internet that gives you what are the sgps having a high volume available and what kind of discounts available right now i pick that uh sgp and i go on the market and buy that particular okay okay and uh  We have one tool called Grip, where we have invoice discounting, I think real estate investment and startup in one. So it does not feel it's bifurcated because at the end, the company wants to give customers the options to choose from. I would have two opinions about this. I would either want to have a tool or a company or a product which lets me invest in all of this in one place. Or as one of the colleagues was earlier mentioning, if at all we could monitor all the investments at one place with some other tool, also it would help.  right so even your platform giraffe and pillow and everywhere you can log on and see individually but if there exists something where you know you can make it a one-stop shop and then maybe i might even be influenced to stop investing else in there because of the comfort maybe yeah right okay uh thank you sir for your time i'll just take a few minutes more uh this is more from the lens of wind and how we can kind of come back to it how can we make experience  the experience is really good the only feedback like i said two feedback that i already shared with the team uh one is like ios app which is uh i got updated and second is like you know uh some kind of reporting where because you know like the way i got uh you know a kind of return in my bank account and i got confused though i got clarified immediately by the by the customer support and it was really helpful but ultimately you know because you know there are so many  money that you have found in you know with windfans so that is the that is the area yeah uh uh sir your thoughts yeah i can i can jump in right so yeah uh to be honest uh i mean i have invested post that but i think i i mentioned before right that that hit piece and i think sidhan shared that article from linden as well but uh but yeah i think in general what the platforms like  back, it sort of builds that confidence as well. That's the positive reinforcement that I would love to keep ongoing as well. And the second bit was, I think maybe this is a miss on my understanding, but the dashboard has been updated as well. Because earlier it used to show only the invested amount and the fund amount irrespective of what's been returned, etc. Thank you.  they are with three years, five years. Same way you can promote as well as who is with Winter Wealth. Like three years the customers is with Winter Wealth. You can give the appreciations as well as you can post in social media that will be create a culture. Right. Right. Right. Definitely. Definitely we'll kind of your opinions and your employee centricity and investor centricity is something which is very critical and close to heart. So,  any value you think we should have for the future as well i would say the trust trust of the customers so i would say even if i mean personal opinion even if one payment defaults or even if one payment does not come on time as per the expectation what is shown on the website then the customer would think twice before he puts in the large chunk in so uh there are two aspects because this happened to me with one other platform the the payments were delayed by a day or two and then i  but customer support is also one of the part. I need to expect from near future because if the asset like investors keep on increasing the customer's support will divert there. No need to like neglect this part. Sure, sir. In the previous part also you mentioned about all the platforms in the wind well that kind of thing which is  Well, I just want to say I'm in line with what Ashwin has said. So trust is something, one of the parameters which I think we should be in line. Right. So thank you for giving your valuable time on Saturday. I think I was just short five minutes over both than your time. I know it's Saturday. It's a holiday and you wouldn't want to spend it. You would rather spend it with your family.  Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye. Thank you, Kapil. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice weekend. Same here. Yo. Yeah, everyone's gone. Yeah. What do you think, man? Better than the last one? Way better. That's a call. Hey, stop recording. That's a\""

And the purpose of this discussion is that we understand you better at Wint and improve your experience with Wint.  because every point is very critical to us so for that we are doing that okay yeah i'll just start by let's first understanding each other a lot i just as an icebreaker so to give you a context i am a couple i work in insights and my hobbies and passion is primarily watching football playing  retired in 2021 December. So now enjoying my retired life as well as retirement brings a lot of financial management discipline also into picture. Naturally the financial management person has to be wise once he gets into I mean when we are working we don't have any time. So now I know that the money is not coming.  some good videos that's all thank thank you sir and congratulations on your retired life money sir if you can go next your hobbies your passions yes hello everyone nice to meet with you so myself Manish from Jaipur and I run a software company I started very early so my my goal is to get retired early like someone is retired  lot of books and basically this is it. Thank you Manish sir. And Deet sir if you can just give us a short intro about yourself and what are your hobbies, what are your passions? Yeah, hi Kapil. Happy to see you and happy to connect with you. Actually myself, Ranjit, I have five plus years of experience in digital marketing  aspects like if I am going for any short-term investment that kind of thing wind will be very much lucrative asset for me because suppose if based on my thoughts I am like how to use this event well suppose if I have like every year like health insurance that kind of thing health as well as some other like  your hobbies your passions uh it's great to know about your financial yeah my hobbies were playing cricket as well as badminton and i like to swim uh like i'm i'm very much interested in this is my habit thank you thank you sir if you can please help me with your hobbies your passions hi hey everyone so this is i 28 uh i work with an mnc company  for an automotive firm. It's Mercedes-Benz. I work on autonomous driving. Apparently, I've been also into investing since 2016. I'm currently 27 years old. So I use WintWealth majorly as a diversification platform. That's my major intent of using this because most of them are linked to equity and I want to somehow move out from that. So I've been also using a couple of other websites as well, just part of diversification. But then my major hobbies would be related to finding what's the new problem to solve in the world of startups.  are you aware of and where do you invest in general? Okay. Should I say? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's an open forum for everyone. Yeah. So basically I invest like, you know, of course, making my portfolio very much balanced in like, you know, equity, real estate, of course, gold. So for real estate,  I invest via small cases as well. And for that portion, of course, bond is one of the thing other than that, you know, I invest in some other debt way, you know, mutual funds. And again, some, I would say some part of still liquid fund and FDs for, you know, for opportunistic way and some kind of emergency kind of thing. And so I believe equity and then debt  money to the equity side more so I am doing that. Okay. Nice to hear that. Yeah, Alok sir. You can just go ahead. So as I told I am leading a retired life and besides searching for a job the prudence calls that whatever terminal benefits I have got they are prudently invested and I have a sustained income that's my purpose. So  startup ecosystem and I believe that the startups promoted by young entrepreneurs they are there to do business and they are there to make a sustainable proposition for themselves as well as the stakeholders that is how I have reposed my faith in your products and I have liked the products and  One thing which I have to suggest, second thing what I have to suggest is that having repulsed our faith, my only request to you would be that to ensure that our payments and repayments are safe. Yes, sir. The way you can assure, it's all investors, not IKS only. Right. Like when you launch a product, it's very good. You host a video conferencing, you bring  very good faith yeah alok sir i will definitely take that in account but right now i just want to understand more about your investment behavior where do you invest in i'll definitely come back to wind and your suggestions for us and any areas where we are lacking but to improve ourselves but i want to kind of first understand more about you more about your investment behavior where do you invest in what products are you aware of so that you know we can  MIS. Right. So those are the kind of, I mean, it's a diversified statement. Right. And if I'm getting the new products, yes, I am trying with caution. And it's only once you start getting confidence built up, you will start investing in other products. So that's how it is going. My only, again, one more suggestion is the post office services have improved  as well as investing is important. I started my investing journey at 2020. In that scenario, first of all, I learned about how many types of investing assets we have. I didn't spend much on investing, but I tested multiple assets. If it is suitable for best asset, then I can go to that asset.  First, I will go for equity. Then I will go for liquid funds. Then I will go for mutual funds as well as bonds and bond scenario also. Some corporate bonds as well as wind wealth is coming into another type of bond. And then I'll slowly go for mutual funds. In the mutual funds also, small, medium and large scale. And which is suitable for me for long term as well as medium as well as small.  get to that space also. Right. Yeah. And type like one of the startup is there. I go for type also because for testing, if it is, if it is clicks for us, definitely we can more go for that scenario. Okay. Okay. Thank, thank you, sir. You have such a wide portfolio with covers. My portfolio. Yeah. My portfolio is not that much.  happened was roughly in 2020 there was a lot of products that came up in the market which we couldn't access in the past so for example startup investments were something that I was always interested in but the ticket size was very high which I for sure a normal working candidate could not put in such huge funds and then somehow I also was invested and I'm also still investing in Grip so Grip has three products which I'm actively invested in one is invoice discounting one is also startup equity so there's one investment that I recently made  as peer-to-peer lending. I've heard Bharatpay also has one, but I've not been invested in Bharatpay. But CRED is something that I'm actively putting some money every month as an SIP so that I expect about 9% returns. In case the market goes southwards, at least this hopefully gives you a little bit of return. But then these products like CRED or those sort where there is peer-to-peer lending, I do not want to be invested in for more than, let's say, two years or two or three years. I'm not that... At the moment,  So invested in mutual funds, equity, debt as well. And obviously invest primarily into the stock market as we're using small cases. And sometimes, you know, friends, et cetera, for lack of better term, right? You get to know this is going to do well. So sometimes you do that because, you know, it's one of them. Either it's going to make money or, you know, you trust your people. Then it's like that, right? So that's the first part of, you know, standardized sort of investing per se. The next one is more safer options, right?  well that give you returns on top of uh you know the cryptos that you're vested with them etc right so right that's the other other spectrum that i have invested in obviously and that's the length and breadth but what becomes very crucial is tracking these investments so uh i mean currently that's the that's the toughest part i mean right you you invested so many places right across so many platforms right so i use kuvera i don't know if you're aware of it  like a monthly SIP or a monthly bond system which you have in place. So what are the various things that which are your things which you look in? Like I'll give an example. When I look into e-commerce, I look in product quality, next day delivery, brand name. So when you invest in some things, what do you look in and what is like very critical for you? So for me, next day delivery is very critical. So I want to understand what do you look and what is very critical for you? To be honest, I think it's more about the allocation of cash  You talk with friends and get a bunch of list of, you know, which are the mutual funds you think are going to be doing well. You compile a list and then you do multiple SIPs in that during the month itself. I mean, it's not only that, you know, you invest once you, I mean, throughout the month also, if you think that the stock market has sort of gone down, if there's something that's happening, some event that's happening, the stock, I mean, last couple of months when the market sort of hit some lows, right? At that time, June or something like that.  buy low, etc. But when you look at the mutual funds one, what you're trying to look at is what's been there in general performance and how do they perform when the market goes down. I mean, that's one of the parameters that I look at. The same thing goes with small case also. I think they give you that backtesting and those graphs as well. So you can just move those around very basic. I don't do a structured analysis, but you can understand that if the market is falling or the index is falling by this much, what is the net-net impact usually on this and how much they rebalance.  critical and if that is not what something you have confidence with you don't at all invest in it see i i mean i don't do short term i mean short term investing is the stock funds that you invest in equity right but apart from that mutual funds i am i'm hopefully investing for the long term i mean i don't have any liabilities i don't have to uh do any immediate spending per se so my thing is that you know gonna be keep gonna keep on investing in them for the long run as  When you look at your financial planning, of course, that is the first homework everyone should be doing. So, you know, what are your goals and, you know, what actually you want to reach, where you want to reach. And then you decide a vehicle, you know, like, you know, I want to go this and I want to achieve this amount. So, this is the path. Yeah. So, it is a short-term thing. It is a long-term thing. So, based on that, you know, you pick one thing. Like, for example, small case is something for long-term. Equity is something for long-term. But, of course, there are mutual funds that I have picked for,  So I'm just compounding. So basically when I decide a product before the financial planning is important. And whenever I pick, like for example, how I research Wintwell. So I first do, you know, like the way you guys already doing, you know, showing interviews and everything, you know, making sure that the product is safe in some regards. So, you know, and then I started with very small step.  you know, like for example, I, I hear, I also want to mention Strata where I'm doing my real estate investment and their software, the web panel that they have designed. It's so intuitive and very, very like recently they've even launched the mobile app. So that's where, uh, went well, uh, have launched their mobile app, but that's only for Android right now, not iPhone users. So I'm waiting for that. So basically that makes your life easy, you know, because you feel connected and, uh, you know, you can, uh, you can see your investment whenever,  how I'm tracking it, what kind of reports and what kind of updates I'm getting. Then the customer support. Again, I really feel that customer support is very important because you sometimes have queries and you want to get sorted out. For example, recently when I got one of the investment get returned and the amount was the principal and interest was clubbed together.  in your bank statement. So it makes easier your life. This is the interest and this is the principle that you get. So that makes your life easy. Why? Because you have so many entries in your bank statement and sometimes it was easy to track. So basically these kind of stuff. So again, to summarize, product is based on the financial planning. I can't say that differs from person to person. But once you know the product and you want to invest, I prefer to start with small.  if you have anything to add to it and what do you look for and what is very critical for you? So, as I said that my prime investment is to secure a sustained income. So, any product which can bring sustained income and can be reassuring to the investor. I mean, it's like if I am able to  objective also. Yes, sir. Whatever income generation can be there, sustained income generation, any variation of the product will be there. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ranjit, sir, would you like to add something? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I've seen Vintual these testing with different assets, like they are repaying like three months, six months, one year.  uh uh origin is a big like three to five years you can increase the origin if we get the interest we can add some money and we can like again invest into this small little bit of asset classes that will be useful because we are recurring investment in the interval if you have some large large ticket of asset when we can invest that asset and we can get the repayment for every month we can add some amount and we can  if it is withdrawable at least within six months of span at least a part of the fund uh i will for sure be on it and that's why in my portfolio i keep uh those elss part a little lower than the the liquid ones so and hence wind has also given me that opportunity because you could take some part out every six months and then this also helps you to go a little more on your investment value because when you have liquidity you could put a little more in and then second thing is the tool itself for example  you so you know gold bonds you know mutual funds you know bonds in general so let's uh personify them like uh if i meet you for the first time how would uh you introduce them to me as friends uh for example uh like equity i had a gentleman saying that oh he's like a fun rock star i don't trust him but he's my friend for a long time and he's just like ranveer singh he dresses flashy and for  Yeah, bonds are like elder brother that kind of thing. Because he's guiding and he can care about like survey as well as any backups in there, they are ready to support us. That's kind of, you know, bonds are related to, it's like a brother kind of thing. Okay, and equity mutual funds and gold bonds, how would you say both of them? Equity kind of thing, you need,  gold bonds and bonds in general like these two people I think say you're on mute so I was saying gold and gold bonds and bonds you know gold bonds basically I'm more like SGB friend so SGBs and bonds are kind of you know kind of I would say test matches so you just believe they are good you know  monthly rebalance kind of. So you just sit aside and, you know, enjoying your small cases, how they are doing it, you know, and they're really doing great. Kind of. Yeah. So small case is your friend that you kind of have, you sit with him on a weekend, have long conversations. Right. And how is Gold Bond as your friend and how different is he from Bond in general? Like an SGB different from a Bond in general? That's a very big difference. Bond is like, you know,  nowadays SGB is also giving you interest so that's again a different way of getting meditation sort of and gold bond is again I will I feel like you know wind wealth till now the journey has been very very short so but till now I am really enjoying it so I would say I feel safe and again it's kind of where there is no kind of fluctuation lot of fluctuations and kind of you are kind of a  a friend with you, you are kind of excited. That gives an excitement that, you know, chilling in a more different way. Yeah. Ashwin, sir, you can, you want to add anything now or you would still kind of pass it off? I mean, as everyone mentioned, equity is more like those friends who, you know, quite, how would I say it?  Okay. Thanks, Ashwin. Aditya, anything you want to ask? Yeah, I wanted to ask you. I mean, I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but I recently read that news on, I don't know if you saw the hit piece on The Ken, right? And I was a bit shaken by that. Did you see the hit piece that Ken has written on Mint Wealth? Or no? Maybe I'll find you guys later. I will definitely check that out. And that was a bit discerning.  are like financial rock stars. So like half of my work is done there. But I would want to understand your opinions and your needs and how these assets are for you. So just give me a moment and let me know if my screen is visible. Siddharth, is my screen visible?  I have a few assets here. One is your sovereign gold bonds, which you guys have, which I think Manish sir has already mentioned about. Then debt mutual funds, which all of you are kind of aware about. Then tax-free bonds and FD aggregation and arbitrage funds. So there's a brief description on it. What kind of interest and returns you would expect? What are the taxation policies around it? What are the risk and loss?  you you  I think Ashwin is good to go. Aditya sir, Manish sir. Aditya sir, Manish sir, is everything good to go? Yeah, yeah. Okay.  I accept tax-free bonds. I believe I have every investment type. I have arbitrage bonds. I do have FDs. I do have debt mutual fund and I do have SGBs. But your rank one, like your... One, okay, okay. Because, you know, every investment have a different purpose. Like, for example, arbitrage fund, you know, for like, you know, I have park money for, you know, the money that I do need for next couple of years for at least one or two years.  I would say in terms of returns, because that is one of the parameters that everyone sees. So I would go with Dapp Mutual Fund, number one, because that's again a good thing and I feel that gives a good return. Again, not for short term. You need some kind of three years horizon at least. I will just spark you up on second right now. I just want to kind of get your opinion on the first one. I'll definitely come back to you.  would reduce down to more stable like tax-free bonds or FD aggregation. And Ajit, these are your thoughts, your number one pick. To be honest, currently I only invest in debt mutual funds for now. I mean, I don't understand what FD aggregation is. If it just means FDs, then yes, I do that as well. But I don't do this with 5 lakh government guarantee. I don't know how this is happening. But yeah, I mean, the one I would go with right now  I can't say no to arbitrage funds, but I haven't gotten around to parking money in them yet, to be honest. But the other ones are very, very, very long term. I feel the tax-free bonds and sovereign bond, the sovereign gold bonds, maybe if there's another crisis globally, then I'll put money in them. Not right now, yeah. Yeah, and Ashwin sir, like other good-to-have kind of a product and one you would say that it's like, okay, it's a good-to-have  like any particular thing? Somehow the whole concept is somehow doesn't look fascinating to me at the first place. I understand it's a rare earth metal which has some value at the moment and people are trading that rare earth metal for a long time. But somehow I cannot connect with sovereign gold bonds for some reason. No justifications as such. No, no, no. I just wanted your opinion around it. Money is,  these two not other three because you know they are not really again they all FDs of course not an investment according to me that's just for parking money for a certain emergency sort of thing and tax refunds again no low return so I would go with some other class other asset class so I will I haven't done and I am not exploring that and arbitrage fund again that was again a parking thing which is you know I have a very specific goal that is why I am using that but if I do  like five, six of these products on one single platform. Do you think your life would become easier if, you know, kind of things would be easier for you? What would be our expectations around it? Sure, of course, if everything, like, you know, for example, arbitrage funds already are on, you know, basically a type of mutual fund. So, arbitrage fund is already, like, you know, someone is already investing money on a particular, because nowadays everyone is utilizing,  where they already have money available. I'm not talking about corporate FDs. I'm talking about bank FDs right now. Tax-free bonds, again, of course, yes, tax-free bonds make sense because there is no ideal place available right now. Of course, they are, I think, one of the platforms from Zerodha provides a platform for having one platform for all kinds of bonds. But the only platform I know. Debt mutual fund, the same story like arbitrage fund. Again, if I'm already connected with and I'm doing my direct  using uh uh uh zerodha for that okay and and how's your experience been so far considering it's very easy like you know like buying a stock uh buying any stock you know you just go and pick the sgps of course i'm using some calculators available on internet that gives you what are the sgps having a high volume available and what kind of discounts available right now i pick that uh sgp and i go on the market and buy that particular okay okay and uh  We have one tool called Grip, where we have invoice discounting, I think real estate investment and startup in one. So it does not feel it's bifurcated because at the end, the company wants to give customers the options to choose from. I would have two opinions about this. I would either want to have a tool or a company or a product which lets me invest in all of this in one place. Or as one of the colleagues was earlier mentioning, if at all we could monitor all the investments at one place with some other tool, also it would help.  right so even your platform giraffe and pillow and everywhere you can log on and see individually but if there exists something where you know you can make it a one-stop shop and then maybe i might even be influenced to stop investing else in there because of the comfort maybe yeah right okay uh thank you sir for your time i'll just take a few minutes more uh this is more from the lens of wind and how we can kind of come back to it how can we make experience  the experience is really good the only feedback like i said two feedback that i already shared with the team uh one is like ios app which is uh i got updated and second is like you know uh some kind of reporting where because you know like the way i got uh you know a kind of return in my bank account and i got confused though i got clarified immediately by the by the customer support and it was really helpful but ultimately you know because you know there are so many  money that you have found in you know with windfans so that is the that is the area yeah uh uh sir your thoughts yeah i can i can jump in right so yeah uh to be honest uh i mean i have invested post that but i think i i mentioned before right that that hit piece and i think sidhan shared that article from linden as well but uh but yeah i think in general what the platforms like  back, it sort of builds that confidence as well. That's the positive reinforcement that I would love to keep ongoing as well. And the second bit was, I think maybe this is a miss on my understanding, but the dashboard has been updated as well. Because earlier it used to show only the invested amount and the fund amount irrespective of what's been returned, etc. Thank you.  they are with three years, five years. Same way you can promote as well as who is with Winter Wealth. Like three years the customers is with Winter Wealth. You can give the appreciations as well as you can post in social media that will be create a culture. Right. Right. Right. Definitely. Definitely we'll kind of your opinions and your employee centricity and investor centricity is something which is very critical and close to heart. So,  any value you think we should have for the future as well i would say the trust trust of the customers so i would say even if i mean personal opinion even if one payment defaults or even if one payment does not come on time as per the expectation what is shown on the website then the customer would think twice before he puts in the large chunk in so uh there are two aspects because this happened to me with one other platform the the payments were delayed by a day or two and then i  but customer support is also one of the part. I need to expect from near future because if the asset like investors keep on increasing the customer's support will divert there. No need to like neglect this part. Sure, sir. In the previous part also you mentioned about all the platforms in the wind well that kind of thing which is  Well, I just want to say I'm in line with what Ashwin has said. So trust is something, one of the parameters which I think we should be in line. Right. So thank you for giving your valuable time on Saturday. I think I was just short five minutes over both than your time. I know it's Saturday. It's a holiday and you wouldn't want to spend it. You would rather spend it with your family.  Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye. Thank you, Kapil. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice weekend. Same here. Yo. Yeah, everyone's gone. Yeah. What do you think, man? Better than the last one? Way better. That's a call. Hey, stop recording. That's a>transcript_1: < you  you  Let me check. Send me the numbers with their name. I'll call. Give me one second. Also, I'll ask you after the JSON thing. I have some questions I'll ask after this call. Okay. We'll just handle.  कपिल मैं मेकिंग यू द वह एक बार नहीं है अब यह जाएगा अब यह जाएगा अब यह जाएगा  एक और नितेश आया है ओके तो कोई है नहीं टू पीपल आर देर इन अवेटिंग ओके तो सेधान अमेज़ सेंडिंग यू एन एक्सेल चीफ इन पर जिंग आपको मैसेज कर दो इसके लिए  Hello. Hello, Nitesh. Piyush. Am I audible? Hello. Yeah, yeah, you're audible. I was just setting up my speakers. No, no, no, no. Hi. Is it just possible that if you can keep your camera on so it's easier for me to kind of connect? Sure. Hey, thanks, Piyush. Hi, Nitesh.  Just give us a few minutes and we'll start.  you  Nitish Piyush, first of all, I would like to kind of thank you for giving us the time and joining us. And we really value your opinion. And I'm Kapil and the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better and how we at Wint can improve your experience. So there are no right or wrong answers. You can express your views very freely here. No one's here to judge you.  It is a start.  I mean, I just have an icebreaker with each one of you. So I'll just start with myself so I can understand you better. My name is Kapil and my hobbies are playing and watching football and getting to know about a lot of worldviews through books. If Piyush, Nitesh,  are you playing these days? So I recently got Xbox. So like I recently downloaded Mortal Kombat 11. I play FIFA and then Halo Infinite Assassin's Creed. I'm more of a PlayStation person. Interesting to see Xbox people. Yeah. Nitesh, if you can help me about  So Nitesh, have you bought any DSLR? Yeah, I have one Nikon G7500 with me. Okay. Any plans to buy a mirrorless DSLR? No, not at the moment because I just bought my DSLR about two years back and it's fairly new. I haven't used it quite much. And even at that time, I was contemplating whether to buy a mirrorless or a older version DSLR.  Okay, so let's just start. I don't want to waste your time since you've just given, like you've taken the time out on a working day. I'm really grateful for that. So I'll just start ahead and kind of understand what investment products you kind of invest in. I do stocks, crypto, bonds, gold bonds. So what kind of products you invest in?  and leave it so it depends on product okay so just a follow-up uh do you have any allocation for like a fixed income uh products or high-risk products like equity like you have a fixed allocation like i have a 60 40 allocation um you know currently i don't have that fixed allocation i just go with whichever is giving me higher returns okay i i saw this trend of me  I have not invested in REIT as of now. But apart from that, I invest directly in stocks, equity funds and bonds as well. And specifically through WinkWealth because I haven't tried any other platform to invest in bonds. Okay. Yeah. And like, do you, like, where do you get fixed returns and fixed annual? Like, do you have any allocation for it? Or do you do it goal-based?  and all. So the extra money that I have is going into bonds which went with offers rather than going directly into stocks. Okay, so you mentioned SIP and that is a regular process, right? Every month you invest some money in it. So I want to understand that when you put money in regular investment products, like what kind of things do you look for like?  turnover portfolio, long-term view. And I like those kinds of funds, but recently I have also been into a bit of, uh, quant funding investing. Okay. So I also believe that quant funds have the capacity to outperform the market. So I have also begun investing in quant funds and a good track record is what I look into before investing.  a bet on it but if i go for something like hgb or the bonds i will see the returns and over what period so how much period will it take me to yield because uh there is this thing new uh which is peer-to-peer uh liquid equivalents or liquid ones that cred offers which also provides similar uh similar  what time I will get a proper return, like in which period I will get a proper return. So I just keep it there, like over time it will grow. Okay. So you mentioned liquidity, you mentioned returns, you mentioned period. But if I would ask you to choose one thing when this is very critical, when you look for, when you invest in products, so what would that be? I would say one thing, the first most thing that I look for is returns.  tenure should be low or the rate of return should be high enough to compensate for that. Okay. So that's what I decided. Okay. So if a product with higher risk, lower risk and higher tenure comes in, you're pretty fine with such products? Yeah, but the tenure should not be too long as the visibility is kind of dicey. Okay.  understand the risk and return. And you invest in so many products and you are investment savvy and you are a CEO, you have great knowledge of financial products. So I want to understand that which is that one favorite product which you really like in all the investment. Might be bond, might be equity, might be good bonds or real estate. So I want to understand what is that one favorite  Asset plus has the history of beating the inflation over longer horizon. And that's what excites me. I mean, other products also have the capacity, but they do not outperform inflation as much as equity does, in my opinion. So I prefer equity over the others. Okay. And Piyush, that product which you really like,  One for different purposes. Like I like small cases for equity because it takes my overhead of researching and I am able to invest in a proper portfolio. I don't need to manage each stock by myself. So I like small case. Then I like WinkWealth for bonds because I feel it's very simple to understand. Everything is provided very in descriptive manner.  three top most but it seems like you're looking at products which give you a very hassle free experience is that your yes side or so when you look so what is more critical hassle free experience or the returns you look at both so all these products give me a good returns like they do like for example if you take  fixed guarantee. So even if I get default, it's a covered loan. So at least my principal won't get hampered even if I lose out on the returns. So keeping it hassle-free and also keeping good in returns. So that is what because I don't come from a finance background. And when I tried going in it, I felt it's a web of things like you know one thing, then you try to learn another thing and the third and the fourth and then everything is interconnected.  bonds gold bonds sgbs as a product and bonds in general as a product so like how would you introduce them to me as friends right if let's say a small case was your friend uh and i met you for the first time how would you introduce uh it to me and what would he wear what kind of personality he would be uh if you can start to use on let's say small cases gold bonds and bonds  forward to creating a portfolio. So as a person, yeah. So as a person, like he's good with portfolio management as a person, he is, uh, I would say, no, uh, easy example, right? Equity. Uh, one of the users said that, okay, equity is like Ranveer Singh. He's funny. He's quirky. He's unpredictable. Uh,  it is like Cheteshwar Pujara like he bats for long five days and it is not the best strike rate in the market but yeah it is that dependable person so Nitish sir if you want to kind of meanwhile Piyush is thinking around Nitish sir if you want to kind of help me with that small case SGB and bonds yeah even I am thinking of some corrective  like Harvey Specter from Suits. So they have everything for everyone, like for every scenario, whatever portfolio you want to make, they will have something around it in and around it. And they prove them like, how do you trust it? You trust it by the managers who are managing that portfolio and also by the thesis or the, you can call it  We're going to L3B.  like the managers and producers, everybody knows them, but not too many people talk about them. And SGBs are like the blackened people, the light men, the cameramen, who we do not know them, we do not see them, but if they do not do their job, then the film will not come out. So just like SGBs, they're not only tax-free if we hold them till the end of maturity, but they also provide as a hedge against inflation.  Vint will would be the kind of an actor who prefers specific kind of roles. Okay, so the so that it becomes predictable. Any examples? Let's say  table that James Bond character is associated with action movies and equities are small case so if I try to since small case I mean small case as a product or as a proxy as a film actor or a character like James Bond is a character so what do you think?  Whereas the bonds offered from Wintwell is a little offbeat. Like it's covered bonds. Not everyone offers it. It's not easily available, but it's something that Wintwell does well. And with Steve, sorry, with Michael Scott, it's like once you assign him a task, he will do it somehow or the other. So once you invest in bonds, it's like you will get your money after the period. You can't, like there is option to withdraw,  like Michael Scott, I feel. And Nidhi sir, have you thought something about small case? No, I'm blank at the moment. Okay, no worries. What I'll do is I'll share my screen. Just let me know if it's visible. There are various products on the screen, various proposition of these products. I want to kind of gauge your opinion towards these products.  Okay. Yeah. So I'll just give a brief of this. There are various products, sovereign gold bonds, debt mutual funds, tax-free bonds, FDA aggregators and arbitrage funds. So you might be aware of them or you might be already investing a few of them, but just for the sake of it, we've given what is a description, what kind of returns are expected on these products  Thank you.  which of these products you feel are like good to have in my portfolio right there are some products that i will say that okay these are good i don't want in my portfolio and there are some products like two three products i choose for my portfolio so what what of these products you find are good to have in your portfolio for me sgp and get funds are good to have  So, SGB first of all is linked to the gold prices. So, and gold historically has had lower correlation with equities and it acts as a natural hedge to your equity portfolio. Okay. And apart from that, we get additional 2.5% per annum on the issue price as well as there is no tax if we hold till maturity. So, that's what makes it  a must have like this so i must have between us a gold bond or a debt mutual fund which one would you kind of prefer it's difficult to choose because i personally i would prefer both we cannot keep a very high allocation for sgb because it may not perform well in the time frame that we are holding it  So they have more than 5% return and virtually no risk. Okay. So it's like a fixed return and their returns are more than SGB. So like even after tax, it's still greater than that. And it's even after tax greater than FDs. So it's still a better option, even if I have to pay taxes. And there is,  say if you had to choose kind of between FD aggregator and arbitrage fund what would you kind of say is the must have or the better in your product in your eyes amongst these two yeah I don't know FD aggregation looks better because it has a tax exemption like a TDS exemption limit and then it  what are your thoughts on such a platform? Like what is your expectations this platform will give and what is critical that this platform should not miss? Sorry, I did not get your question. I'll repeat my question. I'll let this to you to kind of begin with. So if a platform comes, let's say a website or a new app,  we can skip the description for now because anyone who is investing must be knowing basic about what he's investing into the asset class. So that is something that is not that critical, I would say. But I would say interest on principle, the taxation and risk, all the three are critical. Additional notes is again not so critical because it's additional. No, it's just for your reference. Let's say there's one app which you can see all these products as. I'll just show you an example.  in one single place where there would be HDBs, listed bonds, fixed deposit, debt mutual funds, arbitrage funds, where on this platform you can buy and sell securities, avail credit against an investment and hedge risk against your other equipments like an equity or a crypto. So what do you think is your expectations from such a platform from an ease of point of view considering you look at ease of point of view and returns, what do you expect  So having the basket, then proper segregation, like this is the bond and so much percent of it is going, so much percent of it is going here and so much percent is the SGP and stuff. And then it will give you returns so by so, like there are some that will give you in six months that will mature in a year and so, and something like on those lines. So making it clear for me, like what returns I should expect over what period of time.  that as a platform. Then it's very normal actually. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I interrupted you. I was just saying that then it feels like just another aggregator platform, I would say for bonds. Okay. And what would you expect from such an aggregator platform? And what is very critical that this aggregator should not miss?  sense in terms of one because it's a one-time thing i don't need to go to my laptop every time for that one-time investment uh except except that i would say uh yeah just the simple ui basically everything in front of you you can access all the parts of it browse through it good discoverability i would say this having a good discoverability because uh  offering would be a great product. I think there are multiple points that I can think of. So, first of all, since there are a lot of products available to invest, so it will be a one-stop shop where we can invest as well as track all our investments in these products. So, it would be a really great platform. Also,  different site and then compare and then come back to coin right so that's the issue with the coin platform it's great to invest and track but not to compare the available options where we can choose based on our requirements it provides very few features so having such a future where we can compare would be critical another aspect would be that since such a product offers multiple assets to invest in  in the upcoming year or so if possible. Statements which will help us in our tax filings etc. Right. Okay. Thanks, Nitish. I'll just take a couple of few more questions and you have given me such great answers, such great thoughts to ponder too. So one, I would like to understand your perception about us as Vintwell. What do you think are good aspects? What do you think are our shortcomings?  and I was part of it. So I'm quite associated with WinkWealth from the start of WinkWealth's journey. And it really filled a void in the bond space where individuals did not invest too much in bonds or they did not know too much about bonds specifically to say. So WinkWealth has helped to bridge the investment gap as well as the knowledge gap on both fronts.  So I had a call with one of the members about two or three weeks back. And there also I have given my feedback that WinkWealth offers bonds in the space where the bond duration is ranging from one to four years. Okay. So if we have to invest in high yielding products, which are less than one year, there is no option which WinkWealth currently provides. Of course, there are some products.  as we build more and more bonds, it becomes a bit difficult to keep track of all bonds. So if we get a consolidated view of all our investments on the platform, like when are the next repayments coming in, how much cash is going to come in the next six months, so that we can plan accordingly, that would be a great feature addition. Definitely, definitely. And views are what I are things to say about the good, bad and the ugly.  That is the ugly for me. Otherwise, the scope for improvement, as Nitesh said, I really like the idea of having that cash flow prediction. So like when I invest in bonds, I do see that the returns, expected returns, you just select how many bonds, how many slots you are taking. And it shows you that this much interest you will get after this much time, after three months, after six months, whatever is the bond maturity time.  we have to do to kind of get your trust more or get your help you invest more so this is this is not directly a feedback that i'm giving but something that i'm facing so i see you have you have this refer and earn reference system but i have felt this from my personal experience that whenever i recommend someone to invest in bonds  stuff about bond assets, I think that would be helpful. Definitely, we'll take your feedback into account. Would you want to add anything to it? What things we can do to improve your experience? How would we help you invest more? When people look at bonds,  follow-up question to both of you right you just said people perception do you think it's like people don't see bonds in the right way or they don't trust that enough or is that impacts your decision is that something which you feel is happening like when I started investing in crypto my father said what what the hell are you doing why you're kind of wasting money or why are you so brash and same thing  or do you think it is very complex as a system compared to an equity? I think it is education and also that leads to the lack of knowledge of the asset. Yeah, lack of knowledge I think would be because people invest in FDs which is a fixed income product but they do not invest in bonds as much. I mean, they do not even have a small exposure.  are even worse than FDs. That was my personal experience with those. Like I invested in 2, 3 and the returns were really bad. Like 3, 4%. Really bad. And when I saw Wintwell then I was like why to have that mutual fund when I can directly get debt bonds which does the same thing which plays the same role in my portfolio having some debt and giving me way greater returns anyway.  So I just assume that there is no exit and then I invest, which makes things easier for me. But it's worth the extra returns that I'm getting in the same amount of time. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Nitsi sir, would you like to add something or I'm done at my end? But if you want to kind of add anything, any problems or challenges you're currently facing at Vint and is there something I can do to help and kind of connect you there?  something of marketplace on wind wealth itself so you go and just like today I want to buy some bonds I think this would also help Nitish in the scenario where he told he wants liquidity in below less than one year so he can just go see the available bonds on the marketplace who wants an exit he'll just buy their bonds and give them exit right now and he also will get exit below one year  and I don't know whether it's a win-12 send or some other issue but I have invested in a few bonds and some bonds are reflected in my zero that is kite app but others are not visible on the app so I have to go to the dp website to check whether I really have them in my team up or not  some demand like for example zero that do not show it on your uh on their app but you can uh just verify it on the chdl app and you will see it in your demand so it is in your demand but they don't show because it is not listed on the exchange no okay because even i have my recent bonds are not showing and i traced this query with windwell team and this is what i came to know no okay yeah yeah i can see  every time. Definitely. Definitely. So I would like to thank you all for your time. You've given me an hour on a Tuesday, which is a working day. I really appreciate the efforts and the valuable discussion we had. And I hope that Winfield had come to your life and did something. So really thankful for your time and insights and discussions and your patience as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.>transcript_2: < Wow.  कर रहा है कि यह अरे क्या है यार सब यूजर कॉल में देखेंगे वह नहीं है कपेल स्क्रीबिंग नहीं नहीं वह यह मल्टिपल रिकॉर्डिंग्स तीए सेंड आपके यूजर वाले अच्छा लास्ट वन वास क्वाइड इंट्रेस्टिंग आई थिंग देवर मोर वाइड इनवेस्टेड इन एसजीबी देवर मोर वॉमर टू वाटेड मूचल फांड पर लोंग थर्म ओराइजन एंड रिस्ट मिटिगेशन अच्छा तो वह शोड़ अपने  लेट मी सी और अजय को अगर नहीं हो पाया लेकिन इस पेटिंग टेंड फिर दो लोग आ गए नियुक्त  Hello, am I audible?

So first of all, thank you for joining with us. And we really value your opinion towards Vintwell. I'm Kapil and I look at research and insights at Vintwell. Now the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better and how Vint can improve your experience. So there are no right and wrong answers.  myself and I would want to understand everyone better. So I'll just start my name is Kapil and I work in insights and my hobbies is watching football, playing FIFA and reading books. So if you can let me just know your name and what are your hobbies currently Rajsekar sir and then Mithun sir.  So this interaction is also a result of my investment strategy and link with VendWealth. Okay. That's about me. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Nitin sir, can you help me? I know you're a family guy and I'm taking a Saturday and quality time with your family. It looks like quite a fun loving guy you must be. So you're muted.  So yeah, what do you see? But yeah, just let's start. Yeah, I've been in IT, but predominantly been in technology for financial services, right? And that's probably the first place where 20 years back, I got into all of the nuances of financial services, right? So I got an opportunity to work for a lot of financial services and then payments and all of that, right?  idea of wind wealth right and maybe another reason which I came to know later is Ajinkya and I both are from Nasik right so that's that's that's an after effect I would say yeah he's probably missing Nasik from the office so I just want now you've spoken a lot about investment products and investment strategy so I just want to understand what kind of products have you invested in what kind of products you know about just in so  And then I went on for one more. And then after that, finally, I found this guy who basically was heading Ameriprise. And then he's my financial advisor. And I do all my financials and I call all my financials through goals. So I'm not really looking at investing because I want to invest. So I had life goals through which we worked through that. We figured out a strategy of what we want to do, the kind of products.  through wind to earth. That's probably how I've been managing. And Rajesh sir, how do you go about with the various products you have and you're aware of and where do you invest in? You're asking me, right? Yes, sir. I do extensive investment. Okay. My portfolio is quite huge and I touch from everything, right from fixed deposits,  citizen or a government backed bonds even if it is a bit less and also I do tax-free bonds to some extent to avoid tax. So wind-weld as I was telling one good thing is it's an innovative idea because all cannot invest 10 lakhs in one bond because all the good bonds which are more secured and comparatively more secured and yield is fairly good they come  genuine feedback. Sometimes we are not able to really assess the quality of the bonds because so many bonds are coming these days and the bonds details are very what you call abridged. It is not very detailed. So probably sometimes we skip some of the bonds. We are not so sure because even if you  equity portfolio, it's pretty difficult to figure out which bond. I'll give you my simple way I try to do. There was one bond that came from one of the NBFC that's promoted by Slice. I figured out they are predominantly into your BNPL, which is sort of unsecured. Then I skipped that bond. I skipped that bond predominantly because it is something you're doing in unsecured lending.  But then, you know, pretty much something like size A, I would probably avoid because I really don't know how to evaluate that portfolio and, you know, understand what the risk is. Yeah. Thank you, sir, for giving us this feedback. Kind of helps us understand your evaluation on various things. But I would definitely give this as a feedback to my team. But let's just start with me understanding you better.  said by time of your Saturday. So I would, I'm actually thankful that you gave me some time on Saturday, but I just wanted to understand first that what are your investment products, which you are aware of and where do you invest in, in general? Yeah. So I started like two to three years back. So I did this course from BSC Bombay Stock Exchange from where I got to know about stocks and equities and more. So after that,  fell into debt also. So yeah, equities and debt. It's great you mentioned equity and debt because that's my next question. Basically, I wanted to understand how do you kind of invest in like my strategies, I pay all my bills, then I kind of have certain investments amount to make and then I have a fixed allocation which I'll make in equity, I have a fixed allocation I'll make in debt. So you do that or do you think okay, now the market's down,  then I do the expenditures. So I follow that. Okay. And like, I have a 60-40 kind of a balance, like 60 in equity, 40 in debt. My father has an opposite kind of a mindset of having 60 in debt, 40 in equity. So like how much do you put in equity and how much do you put in debt? Roughly, if I would say so, so 65% in equities and others, like in other assets, gold and debt. Okay. So gold you buy physical?  project, it's saying, you know, what's the amount I need, and then work that out with my risk profile to get me an understanding of what kind of savings I need to do, right. And that was that was basically a mix of mix of products, right. So for me, it's not as much around, you know, an equity versus debt. For me, it's about the goal, right. So if I were to give you an idea, when we started off, right, maybe 2016 is when, you know, we went big way, it was it was roughly 70% into anything equity oriented.  That was the time when we decided that probably some time-sensitive goals need some more questioning. That's probably where we went with the child plan for insurance. So that was basically for my daughter's education. So that's basically how I generally go ahead and do it. So for me, the goal is more important than probably just a strategy. Sure, definitely. And Raja sir, how do you go about with your investment?  when you take a holistic view of the investment picture. So I do keep something in income generation investments, some in what you call short-term maturing ones so that I can divert the equity if required or put it back here in bonds, liquid bonds or whatever it is. So the remaining 10% will be in mutual fund bonds. It also includes your wind wealth bonds and  look at the past performance, reviews, delivery time. But for me, the most critical is that the delivery time should be the shortest. So like similarly for investment products, I'll start with you, Rajasthan. Like what are the different thoughts you have and what do you critically look for that, okay, this should be there, so I'll invest in any new product. Okay, I slightly differ from you in terms of the,  the catching point is the return on investment. Everybody will agree that we are looking for a decent return on investment and of course without compromising on the security of your investment. So these two go in parallel. You cannot compromise one for another. So that is the main thing. And the second thing is when the product is launched then there is a  So when you talk about the investment through wind well, probably sometimes as I said earlier, there is some lack of information about decision to make an investment because of lack of clarity on the complete picture. So second thing is, as I look at the reissue of the bonds again, see you have a repayment  out from collecting from the depositors again giving it back for the repayment so if the cycle goes you know then probably we do not know really whether things are going in the right way so first sir i i would definitely assure you that our we have a very stringent risk team and the risk team will look into the marriage demerits of each asset and each issue as well and then only bring it on our platform  company activities and how Mint Wealth is securing the investment of the investors. What are the controls they have to monitor the asset quality and coverage? Sure, sure, sir. Definitely. So Kapila, I think from my perspective, because I'm pretty much goal-driven, I look at the product as to how does it fit into my entire strategy. So what I basically try and do, and I'll give an example.  but more predictable. And then that's where we went with that insurance product. So for me, one of the things that predominant is where does it fit into my entire strategy. That's probably one of the key things that I look at. As I said, the reason I was accepted to a twin 12 was it was filling that gap between FD and the mutual fund. We could very well say that, hey, there are debt mutuals.  loaning that money to, right? And then there is, you know, some more amount of public information available for me to go behind this and then kind of figure out what's happening, right? So for me, it's important that from my strategy perspective, where is it actually fitting into, right? And that's probably, you know, one of the key factors for me. And then as Raj sir said, obviously, from a platform perspective, not from a product perspective, but from a platform perspective, given that we are retail investors, right? We may not have  to figure out that if somebody is able to do that due diligence for us and then bring that up, that just cuts down on the time that we need to spend. So now it's basically more of decision to say, okay, whether I buy it or not. And that is more driven by maybe the team of the company. So as I said, probably slice I skipped because I was not very much interested in doing something that is BNP. So that's how I look at it from both perspectives. From a product perspective, where does it fit into my strategy?  that okay someone is actively looking it on your behalf and then if there is a value I don't mind paying fee for you know getting that value right and and Jatin sir your thoughts on what are the different things you look for and what is the most critical aspect for you yeah so I thought about wind wealth I told that to you I'll come back to wind wealth later on I'll just yeah just focus on what I've been like when you buy  due diligence and all process. So it's actually not possible if I say so for us to do that also due diligence and all. Because at a retailer and retail investors say it's weak. I don't think so we can do that actually. And that 2% of the share which went well invest in all the assets like I have heard that in some of the meetings.  bonds as your friend think of equity mutual funds or small cases as your friend and think think of just small cases as a friend debt debt products like a bond as your friend and gold as a friend right so how would you interest introduce them to me like for example if someone's telling equity like equity products he will say he's my friend for long but he's unpredictable he's like an  I probably instantly I was able to connect it with our ages, right? Because the way you said it, right? Is basically, you know, take a look at gold and that's like your grandparents, right? I mean, something that's strong, sturdy experience won't let you down, right? That's probably how I would look at gold, right? Mutual fund is what you look at your parents, right? Who are trying to balance it, right? As much as they  should I go with WintMelt or not, right? I knew why that product was right. From a WiltMelt perspective, I'm still trying to figure out, right? How do I put that into my portfolio, right? And at the time I told him, right, that I am doing to understand it much better, right? I'm not really doing it from a portfolio perspective, right? At the end of the day, like Rath sir said, right, because the information is less, because the product is not as tradable as the other product.  at the various ranges of all the assets. So just one more follow-up question, Nitin sir. So would you think of gold as your grandparents, as you have said, who are safe, secure? But do you think gold bonds are in the same category or you would define gold bonds as differently? I probably will keep them somewhere the same, right? Because at the  plus some additional person. So yeah, I would say they are still part of that senior citizens family for me. Okay. And Raj sir, how would you determine all these products as people or as characters or as sports athletes? This is a very tough question because for me as a long-time investor, the ground situation will keep changing every time. Right. So sometimes,  that's how i make a call uh sometimes you may fail even in the judgment but uh you cannot keep quiet you have to make your dynamic changes right based on the driving forces in the market right right uh jatin sir your thoughts uh how how do you perceive them yeah like for bonds i can think of like it's some summer friend which i don't meet like  but you don't actually meet but when you meet it's like you really have a good time so right for equities i can say it's like a dancer or a cyclist because you know there are some cycles in that okay i don't really actually don't know no no that's completely fine it's just your perception on things what i do right now is uh so what i do is i share my screen i  Yeah, is my screen visible? Yeah, can see that. So here is a list of assets. What I've done is there are different products. What are the descriptions? What is the interest or returns you get? What are the taxation policies around it? What is the risk? And if there's anything additional which we want to add, I think we can, like that's what we've done.  investors all of you you must have read or invested in some of them but i just want you to kind of have a look at it once and just let me know if it's fine i'll start yeah i'm okay okay uh just give me a thumbs up or just tell me it's okay i'll start yeah just just give me a minute just definitely  Yeah, good to go. Yeah. So I'll start with Raju sir, your opinion first, since you know quite a few of these assets, I'm sure. I would understand like out of all these, like which ones are assets which you're fine to have in your portfolio? No, I have all. You have all, but like what do you think are the good ones out of these? You have any opinion?  sort of investment it should be not more than five percent or definitely not more than ten out of your portfolio if you ask me i will not go beyond five or at the most maximum okay but like which one of these would you kind of are excited to have in your portfolio right uh tech mutual fund is better okay uh then uh fd in small uh finance banks it's also playing good but then  put it correctly 5.2 is the range right now you get only 5.2 is the average range but one good thing is you can forget it no need to show in the tax returns and mostly these companies are government bonds either it is a pfc ntpc all those stuff so 100 secured no issue right the arbitrage fund is a okay you have to take call based on the actual fund okay and and if i give you a choice between a  percent, but I have heard that there is so much of expense ratio and this, so I don't like, I won't go for this. Right. So, but none of these are like your must have, like, at least I'll have one of this in my portfolio. Like I do have sovereign gold bonds, but I would actually like an another product here, like corporate bonds. Like, okay. I know that it is not there, but okay. I don't think so. These are, which amuses me.  haven't seen a lot of them right and that's probably what is uh creating an interest for me around those um yeah that's that's probably the two ones i would but just as products right not just as like you can get hdbs and debt mutual funds from different products but just as products like don't they excite you don't they don't you feel that one of them should be in my portfolio definitely i would say that's what i said right uh debt i am having right so i have  There's a new product which kind of adds 7% capital appreciation on gold bonds. Is that something that you would like or you would say that I would get it from somewhere else? Or do you think it's... Sorry, what's the product going to look like? I didn't get that quite right. So a product which kind of has a tool which gives you like a 7% appreciation on gold bonds. On gold bonds. So are you saying underlining asset is a gold  So if there is some, you know, there is a way to get an appreciation on that, yeah, probably, you know, should be a good product to look at. And when I compare it with, let's say, a well-researched debt mutual fund, like what would be your thoughts on that? And when you say well-researched, right, what's the value that I as an investor would get out of that? Probably a mutual fund which has a higher return and a lower expense ratio.  the product with gold. That's probably where I'm kind of trying to get. And predominantly the reason being I do not see any product with that kind of a combination. As I said, the gold investment has just matured from how do I hold it. Nothing other than that has really happened onto that. If there's something that's happening with gold,  kind of correct price which kind of gives you a 7% capital appreciation on gold. For that actually you told us the alpha but you didn't tell us that beta like what's the risk? Right. The risk being the gold price itself right so. That's it like why would someone give us the extra percent for that? Like I'm not really understanding. Is this helping you identify the right value of gold or right value of a gold bond?  understanding the fair value like let's say what's the what's the face value of the bond versus what's the actual price of gold in the market basis which you should purchase it at a price or not so a lot of times it happens that let's say like what mr rad sir said that gold price when they are released or when the tranches are released was that the gold prices might fall which might actually reduce the value of the gold bond itself but the face value remains intact so the  Does that answer your question? Yes, it does.  supporting the investors in providing such a secondary market gold bonds and probably you're taking us away on that actually it's a good thought in the sense that when you're able to get the say for example the series suppose assume i don't remember the exact latter series i invested in fact every series i invest two grams five grams whatever it is so the thing is now also last 10 days back there was a series  when the gold rate is the same in the market how some of the series are able to give a better return and some are not able to give a better return in fact the issue price is going up every subsequent series so that is a catch there still i am not able to figure out what is the role behind that but given the statistics what we have on hand buying a gold bond at a  I will invest in this. Given an opportunity, I think this is a good investment opportunity. So yes, I do like this. Okay. Thank you. After knowing all the risks and after reading the whole papers. Right. Also now, I just wanted to close the discussion because you can have a good Saturday and a Sunday. Good weekend.  asset. So I am really immersed on that. So from a risk perspective, that helps me a lot. And also I've been looking into some of the assets, like they are coming in for the issue and they are sold in just a few hours. So I guess not just me, many people are focusing on Winfield and are really confident about it. So that really helps me a lot. And apart from Winfield,  That really is nice. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your kind words. Raj, sir, what values do you think we have? And one, we should always continue respectively where we are in the market. It's innovation. Innovation is the very substance of growth and existence. So probably all these new companies which have come up, they are looking out of the box.  transparency and touch base with the investors, not only on the new products, but also on the products which are already marketed through. So that we have a feeling that Vintveld is with us. They are not only just doing marketing, but they also care for our investments. So that, for example, I don't want to mean anything, but for example,  it is. As a company, for its own growth and survival, I think you have a better responsibility and commitment to take care of investors like us, so that we get more confidence and interest to increase our... Actually, now also I'm putting only 10k, 10k. Probably I can do much more than that. Probably I'm waiting for the one cycle to go and see how things are  data study which a company like Windwell does with its huge team so that what we cannot do as individuals are done by you and that gives a sense of confidence and interest in your products. Definitely, sir. Nitin, sir, your thoughts, where do you think is the critical value we should always have?  purely from a bond market for retail investors, there's a good runway in terms of innovation. If you see even in your platform, there are quite a few bonds that are privately placed, which means we don't have a way to trade. That could be a second set of innovations as well. Because as I said, if I am not able to have a good exit strategy, even though the value from a return of investment is good, the overall appeal may be a little less. And I think that's probably where the next set  How can we at Vintveld improve your experience? Any suggestions for us to kind of help you improve your experience and interactions with Vintveld? Any improvement cues for us, sir? I think honestly dashboard, right? Dashboard for me can have some more information, right? In terms of everything. So today it is there, but it's more of data put in, right? Not as an information for me,  So that's one thing. Now, these are products that pay you at a recurring frequency, which means that the valuation now changes. When I started something with 10,000, probably after a year, the principal becomes 6,600 something. Now every calculation starts becoming on that. So for me, that is probably one thing which I would say from a platform perspective, that is where I want to see some kind of investments happening to help us really understand what's happening with our portfolios. Sure.  where we can see like where we have put our money in and like so it could be better like it is good but I would say it is good but it could be better thank you I definitely get your point especially connect with you on the iOS aspect of it Rad sir your thoughts any improvement I really did not go too much into your dashboard and all the stuff because  Thank you.>transcript_3: < Thank you.  you  तो तेरे पास यह प्रेमियम यह प्रेमियम वाला है तो वही मैं अभी आप दोनों में इसे किसी एक को आइडमिन बनाकर निकल जाऊंगा तो  I think recording of the session is important.

Hello. Hi,  Yeah, I can see you. And I'm having it in mobile, so it would be shaky. No, no, that's fine. You're just having a conversation between friends or newly met people. So just think it from that lens.  wait for two, three more minutes. We are expecting one or two people more to come in. Once they come in, we will start. Sure.  Are we, Kapil, are we calling those folks?  Yes. Sunny, is it possible for you to put your camera on so we can have that clean discussion? Sure. Thanks, Sunny. So, first of all, I would like to thank all of you for your time and helping us. We really value your opinion at Win12th and I'm Kapil. And the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better,  in case I miss out on taking notes based on your opinion, I can always come back and come back and have a look at it. Is that fine? Yes, Kapil, I guess one more person is joining in a minute. Okay. So, in meanwhile, Amit has also joined in. So, I think, yeah, let's start.  So Amit, thank you for your time. I was just explaining to everyone earlier that at Vintwell, we value your opinion and it helps us to serve your opinion and your understanding helps us to improve your experience with us. And this is just a call to understand you and there are no right or wrong answers on anything which we ask. You can kind of express your views openly  your release videos for any of the assets which are launched. So I go a lot by what you say. I hear you to the pin drop of every word what you mentioned. So it has a lot of impact on each and every of my investment decision. And I wanted to thank you because I see I invest a lot across a variety of alternate assets. You mentioned from crypto to NFT to your alt bonds to invoice discounting, peer-to-peer lending. But I guess whatever I hear from  Giraffe and certain other alt grip and other platforms. But I guess post this meet, hopefully that will change. Sure, sure, sure. Thank you. Thank you. I'll reach out separately. Sure. Thanks, Amit. So just to, let's just start, you know, I just want to kind of understand you. Let's have an icebreaker here that can you just tell me about yourself, your name, your current job, what are your hobbies, what are your passions, one by one. So, you know, we kind of start with, you know, understanding each  left it midway, didn't complete the third round because I was too much into my job. But I think from an investing perspective, heavily invested in stocks, real estate, all the old investments from the past year, year and a half. Yeah, so Amit, thanks for letting us know you're investing, like you're an avid investor as well. But just for this like icebreaker, let's just understand,  for mutual funds, alternative investments, or all those. So not an avid reader from a book's perspective, but LinkedIn posts, YouTube videos, some small articles, curated findings of certain folks whom I follow, certain people on Twitter, not that active on Twitter. But yeah, newspapers, economic times,  When Vintveld came on board, I was excited that the bond platform was being made open to the retail investors category. I don't invest much of my capital, but a certain portion of it is being allocated to Vintveld. My passions, I do read quite a few books on fiction front and sometimes I follow the markets as well. So that's how it is. Yeah. Thanks, Venkat. If you can,  research about investing platforms. So through, I mean, while doing that, I found out so that's how I got associated with them. And I'm still learning a lot about investing through various YouTube videos and blogs. And I follow Achankya as well and LinkedIn. I'm getting a lot of useful information. Thanks, Achankya. And personally, I like to travel. So generally by two places.  caution and I'm put up in Faridabad. So yeah, primarily I'm in, I have been an avid investor. So currently I'm, let me just give a little background about myself. So I had around 10 years of experience in digital marketing and currently I'm working as a digital marketing consultant. So it was more kind of like an online journey for me because digital marketing is also created online. So then I started getting into more online investing.  real estate platforms also, which are like pools of your investments and all. So, but then I need to only invest in one platform. So then I choose Winfell because the kind of information I was checking on the website, the details of each assets, the research was done behind that each and everything. So then I started investing and all and whatever, whenever the new bond launched. So every second or third bond, I've tried to put even whatever I have, I mean,  So I'm very passionate about, I mean, researching about new investment opportunity and can be anything. I mean, not just restricted to, let's say the stocks or, or like all these platforms and all, but can be any, whatever new investment I want to be updated. Let's say whatever new investments are happening in the market, a particular retail investor can invest. So to how to maximize them also, that is all my passions, hobbies and everything. Yeah. So as I can see, everyone's a very learned and,  investing. So can just can you just give me a gist of what kind of investment avenues you know and where do you kind of invest or where do you look to invest like everyone just flows for everyone. So generally as everyone do I do stock investing, bond investing as well as some mutual funds.  I primarily invest in the stocks through Zerodha platform and I also do the bond. My bond portfolio is through Windfield and a portion is through Bonds India as well. And as far as alternate investment goes, I invested through Grip in the leasing platform and also double some inventory financing. And apart from that, off the offset of the platforms, I also do personal a little bit of financing for certain companies.  but they host all the bonds. The thing about Vint is it curates the bond. And I think that specific focus on some of the assets which you'll launch, that helps make a decision. No, no, I'm not coming to Vint yet. I just want to know you better. A lot more. Yeah. So I'm just giving you context. We'll come to Vint later. Right now, I kind of want to understand how's your investment behavior like.  And I realized that too much analysis leads to paralysis. So a lot of things were missed. But now I think the intention is good info coming from the right source. And that's what helps me take my decisions a little bit faster. Okay. And Mohit, about you? So, yeah, I used to be active in stock markets and all.  yeah that's how I'm currently I mean investing in all these platforms and all but yeah I mean I'm always open for looking out I mean I don't invest in the time I'm had enough knowledge about that platform so let's say I was currently might be studying grip invest I mean what they are offering each and everything and some other things and all here and there so yeah that is all so I just also want to know like like  So I personally want that at least in whatever situation, at least 50% of the income should be invested. I mean, that is apart from that, you can do whatever you want to spend here and there till the time you are able to save 50% monthly. But 50% is something that you need to be, I mean, something like, I personally, let's say currently,  more kind of in a lump sum manner, whether if I'm doing a mutual fund investment, it's more kind of like when the market goes a little bit down, I try to take advantage of that to a lump sum investment and all. And so, yeah, that is how currently I'm in my investment is. So, but yeah, I'll try to in whatever month I make sure that to whenever, let's say even windmill also, as I got a notification every time on my WhatsApp and all whenever windmill launches some new bonds. So I'll make sure that whatever, if it's,  And I think some of the lower rated bonds, even on wind, would fall part of that. So otherwise, from a crypto NFT, another perspective that is approximately even leasing finance, asset financing and all those things will be around 70% of that. So around 30-40 in large caps, 20 in mid caps, around 20, somewhat 20 in BBB plus or minus bonds.  the remaining 20% would go towards roughly between gold and other steady assets. I think I will go next. So I roughly save 40-50% of my salary. But most of my investment will be ad hoc because I haven't found any platform where I get consistent opportunities like this.  in some products. Like let's say I open my app every day or when kinds of give me a notification, things like that. So there are some regular investing products. So I want to understand that like what do you look in when you invest regularly in such products? Like what are your needs? What do you look for? Then you kind of, okay, consider I'll invest in such products. Like what are your thoughts on such behavioral and products?  like you as investors like what are the things you look for when you invest in a product i think returns right is what we ultimately look for so it is uh depends on uh you know equity doesn't have a standard uh rate of return right so when we are investing in equity we in our minds there is at the back of our mind let's say and if you're a long-term investor you're looking at  capital return. When you invest in SIP, what are the things you look for? Ours is to everyone. I guess everyone does invest in SIP. SIP is directed towards ETFs only. I don't invest in particular individual large cap stocks because even picking the individual large cap stocks becomes a bit of a hassle. Over the long term, I feel that  allocation or selection of assets being one like what else do you look into it I think credibility of the product so we have to understand the product and have faith on it and there should be some kind of regulations so which will give us some hope because we are going to consistently invest on the product so we could have safety and return so if all these parameters are good so we are convinced to actually invest regularly in the product okay and uh Ahmed  My expectations are very realistic. But one thing I always take care of is that my principal should be safe. Whatever investment I'm doing, whatever risk I'm taking, I'll take in that manner that I'll make sure in worst-case scenario, if let's say after two years I'm not able to make money for whatever reason, my principal should be negative or something in whatever stock I'm investing or whatever kind of. That is the core issue.  for stocks and I think for cryptos it's more or less how the market is behaving. For bonds it's primarily the ratings. I know they don't count and the commentary which I get and basically established names. So even though the names might be established if the rating is poor then I think it's primarily ratings for bonds and  Just for everyone's like just to understand things better like I would ask this to everyone. So if pedigree is not there, you wouldn't invest in it. It is the most critical aspect for you. That is the touching point like pedigree is critical. If pedigree is not there, I'll not invest. Is that something which you look to? So it definitely adds a lot of weightage, but it's not that  that if pedigree contributes 40%, rating contributes 30%, technical levels contribute 20%, 10-20% sentiments, it's like the score should be above 60-65+. That can take a rough sentiment. That's how I usually do it. Okay. So if a sentiment is, let's say, less than 60, you will never invest in such a product or anything like that.  I, whatever investment is there, I think I'll particularly look out for, let's say fundamentals and all. I mean, because I'm not a investor for, let's say if I'm investing something, so I'll do a short time investing for 15 days, one month, two months. If I'm investing, it's definitely a longer period of let's say minimum of one year. So for me, fundamental of let's say, whatever it's a bond, let's say it's a bond, whether it's a senior security,  the bond of some company and all. So I'll definitely want to go ahead and check out their website once. Whatever bonds I'm invested on, I have checked all of their websites. So how strong they are fundamentally and what kind of, because all I into, let's say, disbursing credits to people or to B2B credits and all. So just for me, fundamental of whatever investment is there, it's very important. Sarath, Venkat, your thoughts? Like what is that critical thing for you? I think I agree with Mohit.  currency, then I will actually leave behind with that product. I don't choose that. Okay. Okay. And you know, any favorite investment and you connect on a emotional level with it, let's say, you know, I connect with bonds on an emotional level because of that security they offer me like any product which you can emote to an emotional level or your favorite product which you invest in?  So I am meeting you for the first time and these are your friends considering you've interacted with them in the past. So can you just help me introduce them? Like I want everyone to introduce an equity to me. Let's start with how would you introduce equity to me? He's your friend, right? You invest in stocks, you understand what equity is. Imagine that equity stock is your person next to you. He's your friend. So how would you introduce to me?  I would say that I suppose. As far as bonds go, I think he is my most trusted friend and I am sure that he would not give up on me at any point of time. FD is also I would say the same thing. As far as gold goes, gold is a little unpredictable for me. He is there but I am not sure what he will give me later on. That would be an apt justification. Equity and FD and  Traditional thought, but yeah. And what, like just personify them, like what would FD be wearing and what would Bonds be wearing as clothes? FD is, you know, plain clothes, nothing fancy. Nothing fancy. Plain, maybe white and black shirts or something like that. Bonds a little bit fancier instead of white, let's say, a lot of pink color or green color. But again, plain. Formal. Yeah. Equities would be dancing their heart out.  interesting everyone's going to interact more on that. Sarath, what you mentioned, I agree with it. But equity do carry the potential of that volatile friend that you need to keep on paying attention to that friend. The moment you ignore him, he can come and bite you in the ass. So I think you constantly got to keep a close watch and keep on giving that leverage and keep on as an extending  completely but I think it's worth taking that bet so I look at it from that perspective so these are friendships like which might work out and which might not work out that's how I look at it okay Mohit you have any different thoughts or let's say you want to assign any actor or cricketer to these four people like who would you assign and why so yeah I think my thoughts are also related to what others said so it's like similar to what equity is definitely for me  If you have invested two years before or like all that. So yeah, I think an FD is something that's like till the time you're investing FD through your parents who are senior citizens, it's good to go. Because through senior citizens, you'll get additional interest 0.5 or 1% extra. Yeah, I'm not asking him as an interest, how much interest he's getting. I'm asking how is he as a friend? Or like if you would say FD as an actor, would you play FD in a movie?  Rahul and also these can be a bond. I mean, I can say because these are newcomers and in the market, I mean, bonds are there, but now the popularity that these are getting. You mean KL Rahul or Rahul Javed? No, KL Rahul. So, yeah. So now these, how these are being, I mean, bonds are there since ages, but now how these are people are getting to know bonds and they are through different platforms are coming through which you can invest in bond like WinFend and all.  to use with that platform okay so we can i mean we have some some kind of trust so as as he said rahul sachin could be good examples for fda and gold and bond and stocks are what to say so stocks i can say shave up okay bonds i would say some other reliable player i i can't find any app player for that actually  Not yet. Not yet. Is it visible now? Yes. People who have joined from mobile, can they see it? Can they read it actually? Can you read it? Yeah. So, yeah.  Basically, a fixed income platform is a platform which will, you know, avail access to fixed income securities and manage your fixed income portfolio in one single place. So things like gold bonds backed by RBI, listed bonds by NFCs and other businesses, fixed deposits, debt mutual funds, you know, arbitrage funds for emergencies. And what you will be able to do on the platform is on the platform, you will be able to buy and sell securities, you know, avail credit  All the different kind of securities which will be available like debt mutual fund itself as a security, gold bonds, listed bonds. So you can sell and buy those on this platform. Okay.  you don't actually do anything to hedge risk directly on equity basically you direct seven so if equity falls like your debt investment bond investment uh or at least uh like their to support really so yeah so does anyone have any further questions so we are good to go  I would want your opinion around this on various aspects. So this is just something which might come up by any company or if this comes into the market as a proposition. So I would want your opinion on that. So if you can, if everything's good to go, I'll ask questions around it. Okay.  it will be useful and I might try it out but can't say for certain though. Yeah, Venkat, Mohit, Amit, your thoughts? I would also agree with that because right now it is all scattered across different platforms so for us also it is a bit difficult for us to manage each and every platform. So if everything is available in one platform definitely so I will also try it out. Mohit, Amit?  same time you have investment on ETS or like different kind of platforms and all. So definitely these will be available in the one platform. Definitely it's going to be a good idea for customer perspective. Okay. And Amit, your thoughts? See, as per me and I'm specifically talking from a Vint platform perspective, I think, see Vint, I look at it as a boutique platform catering to a particular need.  Or you are comfortable with having boutique stuff or boutique investments? Is that your thought? And you would say this doesn't kind of fulfill my need. I think unless there is something unique in this, I think these things are available. Maybe fragmented, but they are easily available, easily accessible. People will go to the least costliest platform and crowd over there.  there's any expectation you think that should be from a platform so you expect it to bring products which are unique in nature is that what i'm saying right when i say unique it should be value adding it should cut down some of the okay so it should value add yeah in can you help me understand that where can it value add so like uh there are tons of debt mutual funds right  to do this okay and uh mohit venkat sarath what are your expectations from such platform like what do you think is expected from these plat like this platform what are your expectations from it so according to me it could be a simplicity so i could reach out one platform instead of managing multiple platforms so as i use the perspective that's what i can  supposing I want to tap more into it, there should be some option where I'm able to liquidate it through the platform. So that is the issue with the fixed income platforms right now, right? They don't offer liquidity. Even if you're offering a six-month or three-month liquidity, it is not complete liquidity. I should be able to immediately liquidate it like that, but that is what is lacking on the fixed income platforms. If that is there in this platform, I think I would even push more and happily invest more.  ratio, what is this ratio, what is the market cap and all these kinds of things. So those can be, let's say, how, let's say, I'll take an example of WinFed. So I don't understand the bond market, but how the information was available there. So it was pretty much easy. Even a layman person who is not much into bonds at any time, he can go through it and each, everything is visible very clearly. So similarly, I'll expect the same thing for other platforms also, whether it's a debt mutual funds, even a layman language can understand that without,  when you look at such a platform like this should be there without this you know everything's a bit dicey like the most critical factor you feel I think critical factor it's mean just to show the transparency like if you're investing in this product whether it depth or what are the chances of I mean risk and all involves it should be very transparent and all should be very clear I mean  And when would you visit such a platform? Let's say there's any product service you would want or any moment like, okay, today's a bonus day I got or like, when would you visit this platform? I would be regular. There's no specific, you know, day or month or day event which would trigger my investment. I think that would be regular. I'll be regularly maybe on a monthly basis. No mood to kind of like today, I'm happy.  Okay. Okay. And Mohit Ahmed? So you are asking when will we visit a website or a platform like this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When like, I would visit a platform and I'm happy or I've gotten, my office went well, so I would want to make an investment or some amount got credited, I would want to kind of  There are a couple of other facts. Apart from debt funds, arbitrage and FDs, the first two you all are already doing to a certain extent. I think you all had some gold bonds, maybe not backed by RBI. I didn't see SGD on their platform, but I think I saw some other bonds which are backed by gold earlier, but not the SGD ones. Some differentiations are there  exploring around platform. Is that your thoughts when I look at this platform versus Vint? So, see, it will depend on how you execute it. Like, these things are there outside. Unless you have curated or add value to it, then it can be of the same caliber of Vint currently. But if you are bringing the entire plethora of debt funds, arbitral funds, FDs, then there is no differentiator, right?  about Vint like everyone about this? I think the portfolio for Vint should increase more. I think it is comparatively less. I know you're picking out the best ones but again I think your larger portfolio and availability on a continuous basis would be better. For example, the product you're marketing right now gets sold out quickly.  your perspective instead of you know as I say waiting for my redemption to come through a liquidity option would be better is what I am feeling because ones which are market are not listed so I am not I may not be able to sell that on the market as well so that liquidity option is taken away from me so if that is provided it would be better okay so Venkat and Amit you have any different thoughts on it so from my perspective what I would say is  other one is like all the products they are having the minimum ticket set of 10,000. So even though it is applicable for every investor, sometimes the investors can have 5 lakhs or 50,000 or something. So even if there are portfolios which can offer with minimum ticket set of 50,000 or 1 lakh or something. So other part of some advanced investors can also instead of just looking for because if they invest in  I think the true metal will be tested when, hopefully not, but if any one of the assets listed default in some form or manner, that is when the risk measures and all those things will come into play. I think, hopefully not. Sooner or later, that might happen. And the longer you all will avoid it, the longer, the more name. So I think that what do you call risk mitigation process in selection has to be more rigorous.  metal will be tested once we hit a roadblock in any of these assets and how you all actually get that recovery done and how much is lost in that process that will be the true test so I think risk avoidance will be the crucial metal which I rely on wind at least that due diligence process never lacks in any form or manner right but any other experience aspect like you want us to improve so you have a better kind of  let it come through. UPI, let it come through. Don't restrict it. I have to put it in a wallet, which is Vint wallet. And those kinds of things are, I think, not a smooth process for anyone. And apart from that, what the others mentioned that sometimes the asset gets sold out and other things. And I think there has to be some categorization. So if I'm investing, if I want to invest five lakhs plus, there should be some advantage, which I should get from Vint. There has to be some differentiation in the clientele. So if I have 20 lakhs invested,  I think that that should definitely continue. Is this transparency or is this something like from this is something which is like what how would you say that value? The amount of information which you all give over a YouTube seminar for a new asset release is not there on your website. So had I read only through what I what is listed on your website and not listen to one of those forums where Ajinkya and some of the other teams from Vint and even the from the  listening to it, I would easily point out the difference. So I think somewhere that has to come back on your website. Okay, so you like our expertise or our transparency if I can ask you to make that judgmental call. Definitely a fan of both. There is no complaints about that. I'm saying we should retain that edge is my request. That's what I'm saying. Right, that's and Sarath and Venkat, like what one value you think we should always have irrespective of what  I think, yeah, I think bonds were, you know, I was skeptical on selecting the bonds because bonds are not transparent. So the transparency which you brought in, you know, paved the way for me investing in the bonds perspective. So I think you solved that problem for me. Okay. And Venkat, this is my last question. I'll be kind of signing off in case you guys want to kind of add anything to help us. Yeah. So bond investing, actually,  what about you like how did we help you out as well I think same I think curating the bonds in what you all bring in I think that's been a big help those seminars were a big help the candidness with Ajankya team and everyone is there that helps the platform is simple that helps I don't know I think you all make money on the arbitrage  for delaying and thanks a lot for your time and helping us understand you better and we hope that you get a better wind experience everyone. Ajinkya, any parting thoughts? No, no, no, thank you. Though I was observing, I was just listening and taking some notes and like just ruminating some thoughts like about RMT but very insightful discussion. At least I have a lot of things to think about. So thank you for your time and honest thoughts. Thank you.>transcript_4: < you  If possible, can you turn on your camera just for a conversation? We're just waiting for one more person from my team to join and two more people to join the call and then we'll start. Hi. Hi. Hi. Anush, Ayush, am I audible? Yeah, you're audible. Great. Welcome.  Hello. A couple. Can you hear me? You're audible. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, hi. Hi everyone. I'm really sorry for joining a few minutes late. I really apologize for that considering you have given us  Thanks a lot, Ayush. Anush, Shankar, Kanjan, is that something which is possible for you? Oh, great. Yeah, I'll just turn it on initially, but I'm going to turn it off in a bit. Sure, sure. I completely understand that. So first of all, I would like to thank you for joining us and your opinion is very valuable towards that. I'm Kapil and the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better  that this will not go in any wrong hands. And thank you for giving your time on a short notice on a working day. I will just start myself let's by understanding everyone. So let's start by like this is an icebreaker. I'm Kapil and my hobbies are like watching football, playing FIFA, looking at various sports. So these are my hobbies and reading out books,  All these types of investments and all I am looking from very earlier this type of platform. But now I get this platform in wealth. Okay. And any new movies you have watched? Sorry? Any new movies you have seen? Just now I have seen two days before that Katputli. Mainly I watched that Aichai Kumar's film. Okay. Okay. Nice. It's a nice film to watch. Okay.  I find it interesting. So being with my job, so I was working in HR before. So past one year doing some freelance stuff for some projects based on Ethereum and Solana. So that's about it. So I was using Win12 because it seemed unique. So there was nothing between bonds and then stocks. And then Win12 was one of the first products to get those products. Sorry to interrupt, Varun. I'll come back on Win12 later. I want to kind of know you first.  Right now I am in Vakala so I have come to a friend's wedding. Okay, nice. Anush, if you can just introduce yourself and I get to know you better. Yeah, I am a techie and like Varun said I am interested in personal finance. So my hobbies include travelling and playing sport.  Yeah, so this is Kanjan. I am a software developer. So hobbies are like mostly nothing. Right now my weekends are mostly around like playing badminton and meditation, reading books or watching movies. The last movie that I watched was like Karthikeya 2. Okay. Yeah, I pretty much work in, I worked in FinTech as well. So on Forex,  I am into software development. I have been in, I think, industry for 15 years now. And I was also part of some of the startups earlier, which were into a core software development. Besides that, I'm also a stock market enthusiast. And I also like to evaluate fixed income products.  and movie enthusiasts on the panel. So I think hopefully we can have a good discussion. I'll just start with you, Omkar. What kind of investment products do you invest in? With the various investment products available, where do you invest in? Without going into specifics, I have investments in US and Indian markets primarily.  diversifying with various geographies. But like in fixed income, what products you invest in or like you're aware of but you don't invest in those products? So earlier, like when I was like graduating from college or like early in my career, I used to buy those long-term RAC, PFC bonds. That was my favorite thing earlier. They had lock-in period but they were giving decent returns.  any products with like 10% of taxation, right? So I think that has like, to be very frank, like dampened a bit of my journey towards Vint wealth. So I actually invested heavily earlier. But recently, due to these issues, I have like, kind of ramping down my investments in Vint wealth and actually and as an alternative, like investing more into some of the mutual funds, like debt schemes, so that I can also pledge those investments and  So, yeah, for me, like it's a mix of bags again, like some of the SIPs in mutual funds across like, as Omkar has mentioned, some in US market, some in Indian market, some is in like debt fund, some in mid cap and something like that, like majorly equity based. For fixed income or bond, something I've been like using Vintwell. In fact, like I was among the first 100 investor in Vintwell.  or like Anush, how do you do that? Like I pay my bills and then I see what amount I've left and then I invest. Anush, your thoughts? Sure, sure. Yeah, so I'm just going to echo what the other two people said. So I have a decent corpus split between debt, equity and gold. I follow the Zazat allocation based on the age and my target. So equity is predominantly in mutual funds and I also have a PMS.  the strict asset allocation. So once a quarter, I review it and then the incremental investments go based on what the asset allocation is. Sorry, go ahead. No, no, no. Sorry to interrupt, Anush. Yeah, and just the last part was whenever I have leftover money, whether it is a bonus or salary or anything of that sort. So I've got this recurring SIPs going, so that continues.  market because that turns out to be a discounted one okay and and one more thing uh which i would want to ask that you said you kind of look at investment goals so like is this goals based on returns is it goal based on life goals like i invest that okay after five years i want to buy a car so i would invest in such a way or my father does that key after five years i'm on this much corpus so he'll invest in that way so like what is your  or like how do you kind of where do you invest in what do you do when you invest in hello yeah hello yeah i'm audible yeah yeah yeah yeah hi i actually prefer to invest in different uh like diversify the my investments i invested in the first in fd also for liquidity uh because yes i  uh any particular thought in mind uh no just i am making my investment in all portfolios every month there is no like goal or something but i've been uh preferred vince wealth and ppf more because i want to take less risk okay uh so ppf and business consider this the best option for investment okay uh ppr is now a little less than like around seven to eight percent interest is given  Hello, Varun, you're not audible. Hello. Yeah, you're audible right now. Hello, I'm audible. Am I audible now? Yeah, you're completely audible. Yeah. Sorry. So Kapil, I was saying in terms of traditional investments, it's mostly passive for me now. So mostly invest in index funds and then for debt exposure, invest in Vintveld. I use it as one of the platforms and then  index funds and then a little bit of debt and then actively manage the portfolio. So that is what I've been up to till now. Okay. Okay. And you have any life goals when you look for, when you invest, like, or do you kind of, no, no, nothing, nothing. Yeah. Fortunately, unfortunately I'm no one is dependent on me right now. So I'm a lot of flexibility. Okay. I, okay. I get it. So,  ease of exit is something especially in crypto markets because there are a lot of smart contractors that are involved so i want to be able to access my funds as mostly stay away from any products that require lockup say most of those products need a one month or one year lockup to get a risky yield so mostly stay away from those and then mostly focus on uh data neutral strategies okay the funds that i manage actively trying to hedge all the positions and then  look into uh instruments or products when you invest and what are the other things you look at when you invest and not just the critical aspects uh yeah so critical aspect is like i look after like uh the expected returns and the time frame these two things are for me like according to the time frame if i'm getting the proper return those two things are quite critical like a prima facie parameter and other things are like uh if it is like how  then yeah i will not worry much about like risk or time uh i will invest in that somehow like whatever amount i can according to my goals uh yeah okay and anush like what are you sorry uh what do you look at uh when you kind of look at various products yeah so the primary thing is asset allocation right and within the asset say for example equity split between  is for you when I actually have a multiple asset allocation? Like how cumbersome is for you to look at various platforms when you do investments or do you have one place where you get everything or like you want to look at specialists? How do you look at asset allocation? Yeah, so it's a little, yeah, it's not straightforward like you rightly said. So there are a couple of platforms that I have to go get the data and plug it into an Excel sheet that I have.  what is the security and all things and how much it is subscribed and subscription basis I will apply on that and mainly I want that windmill should increase the return on the period also mainly only for two or three years the bonds has been issued in the windmill till now right yeah so maybe for four or five years it should increase the period and interest rate also right  For liquidity basis, I maintain another fund in FD and Mitchell funds and all. So I'm not looking for liquidity. So I want for long-term investments. Okay. Can you primarily look at safety and security? Yeah. Then you look at returns. Yeah, of course. Anush, sorry, I kind of forgot. I'm recollecting. You said you have an Excel sheet to kind of look at all your investments.  not within the boundary then it it will just say how much i need to allocate that's all okay okay and and uh quite interesting and uncle like uh what do you look at at the various investment products uh yeah you have in mind and like what are your perceptions on those products and what is very critical for you when you look to invest somewhere yeah so for me uh i just don't look at returns and safety but i always evaluate the product from the taxation  in some of the instruments and not just like equity but also debt. Okay. Okay. And just a question to everyone, right? Have you invested in small cases? I did and I am actually exiting from it right now because I found the impact cost huge actually. Okay. The way the small case managers have productized or even small case,  Ayush, Varun, have you invested in small case? Yeah, I did a little bit, but I just agree with whatever was said earlier. A lot of overhead costs. So unless our investments are really high, so my philosophy is that I'm okay to pay money. So the expense ratio I try to have is 1%.  primarily or an SGB, how would you think of them as personalities, as people, as movie characters? Everyone's a movie buff here. So like what movie character or an actor would an SGB be? What would be a bond be? And what would be an equity be? Anyone wants to kind of take it first or you guys want to have a think through like, yeah,  companies it's about how how equity is like akshay kumar like like yeah so full of action yeah so one person said equity is like ranveer singh right he's very weird out of the box wears different clothes it goes up and down here and there is energetic so you've said akshay kumar which was very interesting so i want to know what is he if let's say akshay kumar and equity is the same person let's he's making a biopic on equity how would he be acting on  Okay.  So the thing is with Nassil Sinta, I thought Nassil Sinta is always underrated and then it's always quality. But then in the mainstream, not a lot of people enjoy, but there is always back and forth in all of his movies. So Bond is also something similar. So since the last decade has been up only in the market, people forget that you need to have some Bond exposure. That's where I think I thought of Nassil Sinta.  or like in any character that he plays, right? And you kind of believe when he talks. What he talks, you believe, right? So that is one key takeaway for Bond. Like they give you the return promised assuming all the other conditions are somewhat reasonable and like everything else is okay. So I found that to have like pretty much similar characteristics. Okay. And  is right. And still there are a lot of people who have not yet explored his acting, which is analogous to Windwell trying to expand its horizons. And Kanjan, your thought? I can't really take any name, but someone like newcomer and doesn't have any back support in the industry, but still is doing well.  movies that much but I kind of no no I was just saying that no someone who's not noticed for long but started to make the presence felt right I think I would I would go with someone like that so if Windwell was in your friend circle right if he was your friend in your group like how would he be as that person in the group  I think Will Will is also like this and providing the return like Raskima Rao only in the films. Right. Right. So steady returns. Varun, you want to add something to this? Any actor would you want or any cricketer you want maybe? Hello, Varun? Varun, you're not audible.  is very sharp but then needs some advertising from others or maybe doesn't want to advertise that much in the group. Okay. Okay. So he's not a very extrovert person. He's more like stays amongst himself, gives you the advice. Okay. He's always the go-to person within the group because everyone within the group knows that that person is the sharpest one.  gauge your, you know, your perceptions and thought around those products. So just let me know if my screen's visible. It's not visible yet. Okay. So, Sidant, is it visible now? Yeah. So,  or any additional information you might need. So just this, you might know these assets already, or you might be investing in those assets currently, or might have done in the past. But I just want you to kind of just go through it once. And I'll get everyone's thought on these assets. Once I get a confirmation from everyone that we're good to go. Can either give me a thumbs up can can unmute ourselves and go like I'm fine with it.  And Omkar, are we good to go? Okay, Omkar is good to go. So I think everyone's good to go. Or does anyone want to kind of take like two, three minutes more and read through it once more? Yeah, I think everyone's good to go. So I'll start with Kanjan. So like you've seen these assets. Can you just help me with some of the assets which you would want to be in your portfolio? Like, okay, these are two, three good assets.  If you kind of have to choose between a debt or an FD aggregation as the must have for you, then what would you choose? I think FD aggregation. Okay, FD aggregation. Very interesting. Varun, your thoughts? Hello.  mid-term liquidity and then arbitrage funds is where there will be consistent yield which is in a way not dependent on market direction so a sort of a hedge in terms of returns are always consistent over a long enough time horizon. That is the reason I will go with arbitrage fund. And if you kind of had to choose one to be more primary or like if you had to kind of choose between both of them like what would you choose?  that can be only captured by institutions with a particular type of infrastructure that I don't have exposure to. That is something that excites me. Okay. I cannot do it on my own. And then. Okay. And, and Anush, your thoughts. Sorry, what was the question? Is it, we have to choose one of this or. Just give me like two, three out of which you would want in your portfolio. And then we'll come to the one.  I'd probably go with the debt mutual fund simply because you would not redeem them for the next five, six years. So hopefully get the tax benefit and also get the rate cycle going. So that would be my choice. And if apart from a debt mutual fund, you had to choose a couple of products, which ones would you like? I would go for the sovereign gold,  it looks to be going up maybe in the next six months and then it might come down further. So probably take advantage of that. And from the taxation standpoint, you know, LTCG will kick in after 36 months. So that's the hope. Okay. And Omkar, what are your thoughts? Like, what do you look for and what would your choice be? So I would primarily go for debt mutual fund here because,  I just share my screen again. Ayush, did I ask you the question? No. I'm really sorry. I missed you out. Yeah, no worry. So which one would you choose as your primary? Out of this, I think I will go for Debt Mutual Fund and Apti. Mainly the Debt Mutual Fund is for because of low risk and high return. And for Apti,  for this network. Okay. And I'll just share my screen once again to show you a proposition. Let's say a company comes out with such a platform, a website or an app. I would want to kind of understand your thoughts and your perceptions around that. Just let me know if my screen is visible. Yeah, it's visible. So let's say a company comes out as a fixed income platform, which is a website or an app, which will give access to fixed income security.  Yeah, I think it's a good option, good choice to bring all this in single platform. But any apprehensions around that? Sorry? Any things which makes you like worrisome like if all these come on one platform or do you think it just makes your life easier? In this, I think everything is included in this.  mislead with the information and that rate of return, the actual rate of return should show in the screen. It's not like top or something like that. It does not mislead the investor that you will get this if you've done this or all this thing. Okay. So a truthful and honesty approach is something. Yeah. And it should be on time. If you're saying the interest will be given on this day, then it should be deposited that day only.  It would be not something that is present today, right? So people would have to park their money, which cannot be used for anything else. So like I mentioned, my other use cases are, I also want to have margin for my investments, right? And I also want to have that taxation advantage where if I have to go and buy and sell on the platform,  portfolio, then sure. But if a use case is to have like, like a cherry on top and use it for multiple use cases, then I would not be interested in that. Okay. But any, any way, let's say if you kind of onboard on that competition platform or that other platform, like any expectations you want that, okay, even if you're coming with this, this is something I would want on that platform. Yeah. One would be like, like ease of like, like doing day-to-day activities, right? Like,  So basically understanding the customer and its need would be like, I think paramount for any platform. Okay. So I would focus on that basically. But you are such a savvy investor yourself. So do you think it would impact you? If I did not have those other use cases, then I would want to have parked some money at least, right? Because that would help me evaluate. And of course, I think returns, we did not talk about returns, right?  mind having some allocation if i don't have uh the other two use cases that i described okay and and kanjan your thoughts on this like such a platform coming on board do you think it makes your like easy difficult untrustworthy or some expectations you want from this platform so is it like will it allow me to like uh do the transactions as well or just like portfolio  it makes my life easier. Also in terms of making transactions, if I'm having the data, like earlier what happens in mutual fund, I had to register with each AM and later then these platforms came and they provided everything at one place. So it would be good for me, but only thing that I'll be worried is my security and my privacy. Now since everything I can do from one place, so let's say my security has been compromised,  to be very clean uh i need easy interface like any expectations from that platform yeah so basically like two expectation in terms of usability one is a proper tracking and proper in terms of dashboard like proper tracking of what is how like how each section is doing and how much i have contributed generally what percent of my total is there and that particular section how much it has gained  kind of planning like what we say plantation of what my funds will actually look, how tax will actually look. Okay. And Anush, your thoughts? You want to add something to it? You want to have a... Yeah. So this is very attractive, right? If this is one platform that I can use for my debt portfolio, that would be great. So maybe RBI bonds have to come in, right?  Because debt is a lot of importance given to taxation, STCG, LTCG. Now, if there is a dashboard that can tell you about realized or unrealized gains, that would really help. Okay. And anyone else wants to add to what would their expectations be? Or everyone's fine with the sort of expectations? Varun, Ayush? Yeah, just now that he said like he should give the  an ios app but we are definitely working on this and we'll do it soon yeah because i'm very much eagerly waiting for that right right so uh now you've said that what are your problems with vint well uh if anyone wants to uh kind of you know and have any concerns any experience improvement uh areas for us we definitely would want to help there and improve ourselves as vint  both users and then the ones who want to get into the product even though it is so a marketplace where you can buy and trade yeah right right definitely we'll have to look at regulations and everything but definitely get your suggestion I think it's a very valuable insight for us Anuj, Kanjan, Omkar any things which you want us to improve I think I have just  there is a principle, there is interest and there's tedious on the interest, right? So if that detail shows up, then that'll be great. Okay, definitely. I think you can view that in the dashboard, but I think due to regulatory reasons, we can't split payments when we credit to your bank account. Siddhant, if my understanding is right on this? Yeah, but it's partly incomplete, but like it is something that's being worked upon. So that's,  can there be a MLD product with like a 10% taxation for the long term? I would jump on it right away. If there is any clarity on that aspect, that would be great. Just like a note maybe that it's not possible or it's not in the pipeline or something like that, that would also be okay. I was just saying that what we can do is we can get back to you with something regarding this specifically because it's a pretty specific  my parting last question is that one thing you you like about Vint and you want that whatever we do in life later as an organization you want that value that we should always retain as Vint 12th like one value Omkar if you want to add yeah not one actually there are many right what I like about Vint 12th is transparency right you're absolutely transparent I have like a lot of I do a lot of your  like there is like disclaimer everywhere that do not get on board uh if you don't understand the risks right or don't blindly put in all your money you just have to allocate five to ten percent of your portfolio so i think there are no other products uh available or like there are no other other owners who give this kind of disclaimers or like uh educate people so i think uh i think that was primarily the reason why i uh i went ahead and actually invested a lot of things  There's some other value we should always have or something we should always return. Yeah, I agree with Omkar. It's transparency and it's display and everything. Disclaimer, it's good. I didn't find like this in any other platform. Thank you, thank you, Ankur. Thank you, Omkar. I think you summarized it so beautifully that everyone's agreeing to it. Yeah, I think Kanjan has given a round of applause to you for that. So thanks, Omkar.>\""

Hello. Hi,  Yeah, I can see you. And I'm having it in mobile, so it would be shaky. No, no, that's fine. You're just having a conversation between friends or newly met people. So just think it from that lens.  wait for two, three more minutes. We are expecting one or two people more to come in. Once they come in, we will start. Sure.

I was just explaining to everyone earlier that at Vintwell, we value your opinion and it helps us to serve your opinion and your understanding helps us to improve your experience with us. And this is just a call to understand you and there are no right or wrong answers on anything which we ask. You can kind of express your views openly  your release videos for any of the assets which are launched. So I go a lot by what you say. I hear you to the pin drop of every word what you mentioned. So it has a lot of impact on each and every of my investment decision. And I wanted to thank you because I see I invest a lot across a variety of alternate assets. You mentioned from crypto to NFT to your alt bonds to invoice discounting, peer-to-peer lending. But I guess whatever I hear from  Giraffe and certain other alt grip and other platforms. But I guess post this meet, hopefully that will change. Sure, sure, sure. Thank you. Thank you. I'll reach out separately. Sure. Thanks, Amit. So just to, let's just start, you know, I just want to kind of understand you. Let's have an icebreaker here that can you just tell me about yourself, your name, your current job, what are your hobbies, what are your passions, one by one. So, you know, we kind of start with, you know, understanding each  left it midway, didn't complete the third round because I was too much into my job. But I think from an investing perspective, heavily invested in stocks, real estate, all the old investments from the past year, year and a half. Yeah, so Amit, thanks for letting us know you're investing, like you're an avid investor as well. But just for this like icebreaker, let's just understand,  for mutual funds, alternative investments, or all those. So not an avid reader from a book's perspective, but LinkedIn posts, YouTube videos, some small articles, curated findings of certain folks whom I follow, certain people on Twitter, not that active on Twitter. But yeah, newspapers, economic times,  When Vintveld came on board, I was excited that the bond platform was being made open to the retail investors category. I don't invest much of my capital, but a certain portion of it is being allocated to Vintveld. My passions, I do read quite a few books on fiction front and sometimes I follow the markets as well. So that's how it is. Yeah. Thanks, Venkat. If you can,  research about investing platforms. So through, I mean, while doing that, I found out so that's how I got associated with them. And I'm still learning a lot about investing through various YouTube videos and blogs. And I follow Achankya as well and LinkedIn. I'm getting a lot of useful information. Thanks, Achankya. And personally, I like to travel. So generally by two places.  caution and I'm put up in Faridabad. So yeah, primarily I'm in, I have been an avid investor. So currently I'm, let me just give a little background about myself. So I had around 10 years of experience in digital marketing and currently I'm working as a digital marketing consultant. So it was more kind of like an online journey for me because digital marketing is also created online. So then I started getting into more online investing.  real estate platforms also, which are like pools of your investments and all. So, but then I need to only invest in one platform. So then I choose Winfell because the kind of information I was checking on the website, the details of each assets, the research was done behind that each and everything. So then I started investing and all and whatever, whenever the new bond launched. So every second or third bond, I've tried to put even whatever I have, I mean,  So I'm very passionate about, I mean, researching about new investment opportunity and can be anything. I mean, not just restricted to, let's say the stocks or, or like all these platforms and all, but can be any, whatever new investment I want to be updated. Let's say whatever new investments are happening in the market, a particular retail investor can invest. So to how to maximize them also, that is all my passions, hobbies and everything. Yeah. So as I can see, everyone's a very learned and,  investing. So can just can you just give me a gist of what kind of investment avenues you know and where do you kind of invest or where do you look to invest like everyone just flows for everyone. So generally as everyone do I do stock investing, bond investing as well as some mutual funds.  I primarily invest in the stocks through Zerodha platform and I also do the bond. My bond portfolio is through Windfield and a portion is through Bonds India as well. And as far as alternate investment goes, I invested through Grip in the leasing platform and also double some inventory financing. And apart from that, off the offset of the platforms, I also do personal a little bit of financing for certain companies.  but they host all the bonds. The thing about Vint is it curates the bond. And I think that specific focus on some of the assets which you'll launch, that helps make a decision. No, no, I'm not coming to Vint yet. I just want to know you better. A lot more. Yeah. So I'm just giving you context. We'll come to Vint later. Right now, I kind of want to understand how's your investment behavior like.  And I realized that too much analysis leads to paralysis. So a lot of things were missed. But now I think the intention is good info coming from the right source. And that's what helps me take my decisions a little bit faster. Okay. And Mohit, about you? So, yeah, I used to be active in stock markets and all.  yeah that's how I'm currently I mean investing in all these platforms and all but yeah I mean I'm always open for looking out I mean I don't invest in the time I'm had enough knowledge about that platform so let's say I was currently might be studying grip invest I mean what they are offering each and everything and some other things and all here and there so yeah that is all so I just also want to know like like  So I personally want that at least in whatever situation, at least 50% of the income should be invested. I mean, that is apart from that, you can do whatever you want to spend here and there till the time you are able to save 50% monthly. But 50% is something that you need to be, I mean, something like, I personally, let's say currently,  more kind of in a lump sum manner, whether if I'm doing a mutual fund investment, it's more kind of like when the market goes a little bit down, I try to take advantage of that to a lump sum investment and all. And so, yeah, that is how currently I'm in my investment is. So, but yeah, I'll try to in whatever month I make sure that to whenever, let's say even windmill also, as I got a notification every time on my WhatsApp and all whenever windmill launches some new bonds. So I'll make sure that whatever, if it's,  And I think some of the lower rated bonds, even on wind, would fall part of that. So otherwise, from a crypto NFT, another perspective that is approximately even leasing finance, asset financing and all those things will be around 70% of that. So around 30-40 in large caps, 20 in mid caps, around 20, somewhat 20 in BBB plus or minus bonds.  the remaining 20% would go towards roughly between gold and other steady assets. I think I will go next. So I roughly save 40-50% of my salary. But most of my investment will be ad hoc because I haven't found any platform where I get consistent opportunities like this.  in some products. Like let's say I open my app every day or when kinds of give me a notification, things like that. So there are some regular investing products. So I want to understand that like what do you look in when you invest regularly in such products? Like what are your needs? What do you look for? Then you kind of, okay, consider I'll invest in such products. Like what are your thoughts on such behavioral and products?  like you as investors like what are the things you look for when you invest in a product i think returns right is what we ultimately look for so it is uh depends on uh you know equity doesn't have a standard uh rate of return right so when we are investing in equity we in our minds there is at the back of our mind let's say and if you're a long-term investor you're looking at  capital return. When you invest in SIP, what are the things you look for? Ours is to everyone. I guess everyone does invest in SIP. SIP is directed towards ETFs only. I don't invest in particular individual large cap stocks because even picking the individual large cap stocks becomes a bit of a hassle. Over the long term, I feel that  allocation or selection of assets being one like what else do you look into it I think credibility of the product so we have to understand the product and have faith on it and there should be some kind of regulations so which will give us some hope because we are going to consistently invest on the product so we could have safety and return so if all these parameters are good so we are convinced to actually invest regularly in the product okay and uh Ahmed  My expectations are very realistic. But one thing I always take care of is that my principal should be safe. Whatever investment I'm doing, whatever risk I'm taking, I'll take in that manner that I'll make sure in worst-case scenario, if let's say after two years I'm not able to make money for whatever reason, my principal should be negative or something in whatever stock I'm investing or whatever kind of. That is the core issue.  for stocks and I think for cryptos it's more or less how the market is behaving. For bonds it's primarily the ratings. I know they don't count and the commentary which I get and basically established names. So even though the names might be established if the rating is poor then I think it's primarily ratings for bonds and  Just for everyone's like just to understand things better like I would ask this to everyone. So if pedigree is not there, you wouldn't invest in it. It is the most critical aspect for you. That is the touching point like pedigree is critical. If pedigree is not there, I'll not invest. Is that something which you look to? So it definitely adds a lot of weightage, but it's not that  that if pedigree contributes 40%, rating contributes 30%, technical levels contribute 20%, 10-20% sentiments, it's like the score should be above 60-65+. That can take a rough sentiment. That's how I usually do it. Okay. So if a sentiment is, let's say, less than 60, you will never invest in such a product or anything like that.  I, whatever investment is there, I think I'll particularly look out for, let's say fundamentals and all. I mean, because I'm not a investor for, let's say if I'm investing something, so I'll do a short time investing for 15 days, one month, two months. If I'm investing, it's definitely a longer period of let's say minimum of one year. So for me, fundamental of let's say, whatever it's a bond, let's say it's a bond, whether it's a senior security,  the bond of some company and all. So I'll definitely want to go ahead and check out their website once. Whatever bonds I'm invested on, I have checked all of their websites. So how strong they are fundamentally and what kind of, because all I into, let's say, disbursing credits to people or to B2B credits and all. So just for me, fundamental of whatever investment is there, it's very important. Sarath, Venkat, your thoughts? Like what is that critical thing for you? I think I agree with Mohit.  currency, then I will actually leave behind with that product. I don't choose that. Okay. Okay. And you know, any favorite investment and you connect on a emotional level with it, let's say, you know, I connect with bonds on an emotional level because of that security they offer me like any product which you can emote to an emotional level or your favorite product which you invest in?  So I am meeting you for the first time and these are your friends considering you've interacted with them in the past. So can you just help me introduce them? Like I want everyone to introduce an equity to me. Let's start with how would you introduce equity to me? He's your friend, right? You invest in stocks, you understand what equity is. Imagine that equity stock is your person next to you. He's your friend. So how would you introduce to me?  I would say that I suppose. As far as bonds go, I think he is my most trusted friend and I am sure that he would not give up on me at any point of time. FD is also I would say the same thing. As far as gold goes, gold is a little unpredictable for me. He is there but I am not sure what he will give me later on. That would be an apt justification. Equity and FD and  Traditional thought, but yeah. And what, like just personify them, like what would FD be wearing and what would Bonds be wearing as clothes? FD is, you know, plain clothes, nothing fancy. Nothing fancy. Plain, maybe white and black shirts or something like that. Bonds a little bit fancier instead of white, let's say, a lot of pink color or green color. But again, plain. Formal. Yeah. Equities would be dancing their heart out.  interesting everyone's going to interact more on that. Sarath, what you mentioned, I agree with it. But equity do carry the potential of that volatile friend that you need to keep on paying attention to that friend. The moment you ignore him, he can come and bite you in the ass. So I think you constantly got to keep a close watch and keep on giving that leverage and keep on as an extending  completely but I think it's worth taking that bet so I look at it from that perspective so these are friendships like which might work out and which might not work out that's how I look at it okay Mohit you have any different thoughts or let's say you want to assign any actor or cricketer to these four people like who would you assign and why so yeah I think my thoughts are also related to what others said so it's like similar to what equity is definitely for me  If you have invested two years before or like all that. So yeah, I think an FD is something that's like till the time you're investing FD through your parents who are senior citizens, it's good to go. Because through senior citizens, you'll get additional interest 0.5 or 1% extra. Yeah, I'm not asking him as an interest, how much interest he's getting. I'm asking how is he as a friend? Or like if you would say FD as an actor, would you play FD in a movie?  Rahul and also these can be a bond. I mean, I can say because these are newcomers and in the market, I mean, bonds are there, but now the popularity that these are getting. You mean KL Rahul or Rahul Javed? No, KL Rahul. So, yeah. So now these, how these are being, I mean, bonds are there since ages, but now how these are people are getting to know bonds and they are through different platforms are coming through which you can invest in bond like WinFend and all.  to use with that platform okay so we can i mean we have some some kind of trust so as as he said rahul sachin could be good examples for fda and gold and bond and stocks are what to say so stocks i can say shave up okay bonds i would say some other reliable player i i can't find any app player for that actually  Not yet. Not yet. Is it visible now? Yes. People who have joined from mobile, can they see it? Can they read it actually? Can you read it? Yeah. So, yeah.  Basically, a fixed income platform is a platform which will, you know, avail access to fixed income securities and manage your fixed income portfolio in one single place. So things like gold bonds backed by RBI, listed bonds by NFCs and other businesses, fixed deposits, debt mutual funds, you know, arbitrage funds for emergencies. And what you will be able to do on the platform is on the platform, you will be able to buy and sell securities, you know, avail credit  All the different kind of securities which will be available like debt mutual fund itself as a security, gold bonds, listed bonds. So you can sell and buy those on this platform. Okay.  you don't actually do anything to hedge risk directly on equity basically you direct seven so if equity falls like your debt investment bond investment uh or at least uh like their to support really so yeah so does anyone have any further questions so we are good to go  I would want your opinion around this on various aspects. So this is just something which might come up by any company or if this comes into the market as a proposition. So I would want your opinion on that. So if you can, if everything's good to go, I'll ask questions around it. Okay.  it will be useful and I might try it out but can't say for certain though. Yeah, Venkat, Mohit, Amit, your thoughts? I would also agree with that because right now it is all scattered across different platforms so for us also it is a bit difficult for us to manage each and every platform. So if everything is available in one platform definitely so I will also try it out. Mohit, Amit?  same time you have investment on ETS or like different kind of platforms and all. So definitely these will be available in the one platform. Definitely it's going to be a good idea for customer perspective. Okay. And Amit, your thoughts? See, as per me and I'm specifically talking from a Vint platform perspective, I think, see Vint, I look at it as a boutique platform catering to a particular need.  Or you are comfortable with having boutique stuff or boutique investments? Is that your thought? And you would say this doesn't kind of fulfill my need. I think unless there is something unique in this, I think these things are available. Maybe fragmented, but they are easily available, easily accessible. People will go to the least costliest platform and crowd over there.  there's any expectation you think that should be from a platform so you expect it to bring products which are unique in nature is that what i'm saying right when i say unique it should be value adding it should cut down some of the okay so it should value add yeah in can you help me understand that where can it value add so like uh there are tons of debt mutual funds right  to do this okay and uh mohit venkat sarath what are your expectations from such platform like what do you think is expected from these plat like this platform what are your expectations from it so according to me it could be a simplicity so i could reach out one platform instead of managing multiple platforms so as i use the perspective that's what i can  supposing I want to tap more into it, there should be some option where I'm able to liquidate it through the platform. So that is the issue with the fixed income platforms right now, right? They don't offer liquidity. Even if you're offering a six-month or three-month liquidity, it is not complete liquidity. I should be able to immediately liquidate it like that, but that is what is lacking on the fixed income platforms. If that is there in this platform, I think I would even push more and happily invest more.  ratio, what is this ratio, what is the market cap and all these kinds of things. So those can be, let's say, how, let's say, I'll take an example of WinFed. So I don't understand the bond market, but how the information was available there. So it was pretty much easy. Even a layman person who is not much into bonds at any time, he can go through it and each, everything is visible very clearly. So similarly, I'll expect the same thing for other platforms also, whether it's a debt mutual funds, even a layman language can understand that without,  when you look at such a platform like this should be there without this you know everything's a bit dicey like the most critical factor you feel I think critical factor it's mean just to show the transparency like if you're investing in this product whether it depth or what are the chances of I mean risk and all involves it should be very transparent and all should be very clear I mean  And when would you visit such a platform? Let's say there's any product service you would want or any moment like, okay, today's a bonus day I got or like, when would you visit this platform? I would be regular. There's no specific, you know, day or month or day event which would trigger my investment. I think that would be regular. I'll be regularly maybe on a monthly basis. No mood to kind of like today, I'm happy.  Okay. Okay. And Mohit Ahmed? So you are asking when will we visit a website or a platform like this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When like, I would visit a platform and I'm happy or I've gotten, my office went well, so I would want to make an investment or some amount got credited, I would want to kind of  There are a couple of other facts. Apart from debt funds, arbitrage and FDs, the first two you all are already doing to a certain extent. I think you all had some gold bonds, maybe not backed by RBI. I didn't see SGD on their platform, but I think I saw some other bonds which are backed by gold earlier, but not the SGD ones. Some differentiations are there  exploring around platform. Is that your thoughts when I look at this platform versus Vint? So, see, it will depend on how you execute it. Like, these things are there outside. Unless you have curated or add value to it, then it can be of the same caliber of Vint currently. But if you are bringing the entire plethora of debt funds, arbitral funds, FDs, then there is no differentiator, right?  about Vint like everyone about this? I think the portfolio for Vint should increase more. I think it is comparatively less. I know you're picking out the best ones but again I think your larger portfolio and availability on a continuous basis would be better. For example, the product you're marketing right now gets sold out quickly.  your perspective instead of you know as I say waiting for my redemption to come through a liquidity option would be better is what I am feeling because ones which are market are not listed so I am not I may not be able to sell that on the market as well so that liquidity option is taken away from me so if that is provided it would be better okay so Venkat and Amit you have any different thoughts on it so from my perspective what I would say is  other one is like all the products they are having the minimum ticket set of 10,000. So even though it is applicable for every investor, sometimes the investors can have 5 lakhs or 50,000 or something. So even if there are portfolios which can offer with minimum ticket set of 50,000 or 1 lakh or something. So other part of some advanced investors can also instead of just looking for because if they invest in  I think the true metal will be tested when, hopefully not, but if any one of the assets listed default in some form or manner, that is when the risk measures and all those things will come into play. I think, hopefully not. Sooner or later, that might happen. And the longer you all will avoid it, the longer, the more name. So I think that what do you call risk mitigation process in selection has to be more rigorous.  metal will be tested once we hit a roadblock in any of these assets and how you all actually get that recovery done and how much is lost in that process that will be the true test so I think risk avoidance will be the crucial metal which I rely on wind at least that due diligence process never lacks in any form or manner right but any other experience aspect like you want us to improve so you have a better kind of  let it come through. UPI, let it come through. Don't restrict it. I have to put it in a wallet, which is Vint wallet. And those kinds of things are, I think, not a smooth process for anyone. And apart from that, what the others mentioned that sometimes the asset gets sold out and other things. And I think there has to be some categorization. So if I'm investing, if I want to invest five lakhs plus, there should be some advantage, which I should get from Vint. There has to be some differentiation in the clientele. So if I have 20 lakhs invested,  I think that that should definitely continue. Is this transparency or is this something like from this is something which is like what how would you say that value? The amount of information which you all give over a YouTube seminar for a new asset release is not there on your website. So had I read only through what I what is listed on your website and not listen to one of those forums where Ajinkya and some of the other teams from Vint and even the from the  listening to it, I would easily point out the difference. So I think somewhere that has to come back on your website. Okay, so you like our expertise or our transparency if I can ask you to make that judgmental call. Definitely a fan of both. There is no complaints about that. I'm saying we should retain that edge is my request. That's what I'm saying. Right, that's and Sarath and Venkat, like what one value you think we should always have irrespective of what  I think, yeah, I think bonds were, you know, I was skeptical on selecting the bonds because bonds are not transparent. So the transparency which you brought in, you know, paved the way for me investing in the bonds perspective. So I think you solved that problem for me. Okay. And Venkat, this is my last question. I'll be kind of signing off in case you guys want to kind of add anything to help us. Yeah. So bond investing, actually,  what about you like how did we help you out as well I think same I think curating the bonds in what you all bring in I think that's been a big help those seminars were a big help the candidness with Ajankya team and everyone is there that helps the platform is simple that helps I don't know I think you all make money on the arbitrage  for delaying and thanks a lot for your time and helping us understand you better and we hope that you get a better wind experience everyone. Ajinkya, any parting thoughts? No, no, no, thank you. Though I was observing, I was just listening and taking some notes and like just ruminating some thoughts like about RMT but very insightful discussion. At least I have a lot of things to think about. So thank you for your time and honest thoughts. Thank you.\""

I would also request Ranjit sir and Aditya sir, if you can please turn your camera on if that\\'s possible. Actually, I\\'m outside. That\\'s why I\\'m not opening my video. No, no, no. That\\'s fine. If you\\'re outside, then it\\'s completely fine. I just wanted to kind of understand if, yeah.  correct with your guest. I think it\\'s a Saturday and we are taking your time on a Saturday. No, no, no. It\\'s all right. Till the time they don\\'t arrive, I\\'ll be with you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. So I would like to thank first all of you for your time for joining us. And your opinion really matters to us a lot. So I\\'m Kapil and I work at Wentwith. And the purpose of this discussion is that we understand you better at Wint and improve your experience with Wint.  because every point is very critical to us so for that we are doing that okay yeah i\\'ll just start by let\\'s first understanding each other a lot i just as an icebreaker so to give you a context i am a couple i work in insights and my hobbies and passion is primarily watching football playing  retired in 2021 December. So now enjoying my retired life as well as retirement brings a lot of financial management discipline also into picture. Naturally the financial management person has to be wise once he gets into I mean when we are working we don\\'t have any time. So now I know that the money is not coming.  some good videos that\\'s all thank thank you sir and congratulations on your retired life money sir if you can go next your hobbies your passions yes hello everyone nice to meet with you so myself Manish from Jaipur and I run a software company I started very early so my my goal is to get retired early like someone is retired  lot of books and basically this is it. Thank you Manish sir. And Deet sir if you can just give us a short intro about yourself and what are your hobbies, what are your passions? Yeah, hi Kapil. Happy to see you and happy to connect with you. Actually myself, Ranjit, I have five plus years of experience in digital marketing  aspects like if I am going for any short-term investment that kind of thing wind will be very much lucrative asset for me because suppose if based on my thoughts I am like how to use this event well suppose if I have like every year like health insurance that kind of thing health as well as some other like  your hobbies your passions uh it\\'s great to know about your financial yeah my hobbies were playing cricket as well as badminton and i like to swim uh like i\\'m i\\'m very much interested in this is my habit thank you thank you sir if you can please help me with your hobbies your passions hi hey everyone so this is i 28 uh i work with an mnc company  for an automotive firm. It\\'s Mercedes-Benz. I work on autonomous driving. Apparently, I\\'ve been also into investing since 2016. I\\'m currently 27 years old. So I use WintWealth majorly as a diversification platform. That\\'s my major intent of using this because most of them are linked to equity and I want to somehow move out from that. So I\\'ve been also using a couple of other websites as well, just part of diversification. But then my major hobbies would be related to finding what\\'s the new problem to solve in the world of startups.  are you aware of and where do you invest in general? Okay. Should I say? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It\\'s an open forum for everyone. Yeah. So basically I invest like, you know, of course, making my portfolio very much balanced in like, you know, equity, real estate, of course, gold. So for real estate,  I invest via small cases as well. And for that portion, of course, bond is one of the thing other than that, you know, I invest in some other debt way, you know, mutual funds. And again, some, I would say some part of still liquid fund and FDs for, you know, for opportunistic way and some kind of emergency kind of thing. And so I believe equity and then debt  money to the equity side more so I am doing that. Okay. Nice to hear that. Yeah, Alok sir. You can just go ahead. So as I told I am leading a retired life and besides searching for a job the prudence calls that whatever terminal benefits I have got they are prudently invested and I have a sustained income that\\'s my purpose. So  startup ecosystem and I believe that the startups promoted by young entrepreneurs they are there to do business and they are there to make a sustainable proposition for themselves as well as the stakeholders that is how I have reposed my faith in your products and I have liked the products and  One thing which I have to suggest, second thing what I have to suggest is that having repulsed our faith, my only request to you would be that to ensure that our payments and repayments are safe. Yes, sir. The way you can assure, it\\'s all investors, not IKS only. Right. Like when you launch a product, it\\'s very good. You host a video conferencing, you bring  very good faith yeah alok sir i will definitely take that in account but right now i just want to understand more about your investment behavior where do you invest in i\\'ll definitely come back to wind and your suggestions for us and any areas where we are lacking but to improve ourselves but i want to kind of first understand more about you more about your investment behavior where do you invest in what products are you aware of so that you know we can  MIS. Right. So those are the kind of, I mean, it\\'s a diversified statement. Right. And if I\\'m getting the new products, yes, I am trying with caution. And it\\'s only once you start getting confidence built up, you will start investing in other products. So that\\'s how it is going. My only, again, one more suggestion is the post office services have improved  as well as investing is important. I started my investing journey at 2020. In that scenario, first of all, I learned about how many types of investing assets we have. I didn\\'t spend much on investing, but I tested multiple assets. If it is suitable for best asset, then I can go to that asset.  First, I will go for equity. Then I will go for liquid funds. Then I will go for mutual funds as well as bonds and bond scenario also. Some corporate bonds as well as wind wealth is coming into another type of bond. And then I\\'ll slowly go for mutual funds. In the mutual funds also, small, medium and large scale. And which is suitable for me for long term as well as medium as well as small.  get to that space also. Right. Yeah. And type like one of the startup is there. I go for type also because for testing, if it is, if it is clicks for us, definitely we can more go for that scenario. Okay. Okay. Thank, thank you, sir. You have such a wide portfolio with covers. My portfolio. Yeah. My portfolio is not that much.  happened was roughly in 2020 there was a lot of products that came up in the market which we couldn\\'t access in the past so for example startup investments were something that I was always interested in but the ticket size was very high which I for sure a normal working candidate could not put in such huge funds and then somehow I also was invested and I\\'m also still investing in Grip so Grip has three products which I\\'m actively invested in one is invoice discounting one is also startup equity so there\\'s one investment that I recently made  as peer-to-peer lending. I\\'ve heard Bharatpay also has one, but I\\'ve not been invested in Bharatpay. But CRED is something that I\\'m actively putting some money every month as an SIP so that I expect about 9% returns. In case the market goes southwards, at least this hopefully gives you a little bit of return. But then these products like CRED or those sort where there is peer-to-peer lending, I do not want to be invested in for more than, let\\'s say, two years or two or three years. I\\'m not that... At the moment,  So invested in mutual funds, equity, debt as well. And obviously invest primarily into the stock market as we\\'re using small cases. And sometimes, you know, friends, et cetera, for lack of better term, right? You get to know this is going to do well. So sometimes you do that because, you know, it\\'s one of them. Either it\\'s going to make money or, you know, you trust your people. Then it\\'s like that, right? So that\\'s the first part of, you know, standardized sort of investing per se. The next one is more safer options, right?  well that give you returns on top of uh you know the cryptos that you\\'re vested with them etc right so right that\\'s the other other spectrum that i have invested in obviously and that\\'s the length and breadth but what becomes very crucial is tracking these investments so uh i mean currently that\\'s the that\\'s the toughest part i mean right you you invested so many places right across so many platforms right so i use kuvera i don\\'t know if you\\'re aware of it  like a monthly SIP or a monthly bond system which you have in place. So what are the various things that which are your things which you look in? Like I\\'ll give an example. When I look into e-commerce, I look in product quality, next day delivery, brand name. So when you invest in some things, what do you look in and what is like very critical for you? So for me, next day delivery is very critical. So I want to understand what do you look and what is very critical for you? To be honest, I think it\\'s more about the allocation of cash  You talk with friends and get a bunch of list of, you know, which are the mutual funds you think are going to be doing well. You compile a list and then you do multiple SIPs in that during the month itself. I mean, it\\'s not only that, you know, you invest once you, I mean, throughout the month also, if you think that the stock market has sort of gone down, if there\\'s something that\\'s happening, some event that\\'s happening, the stock, I mean, last couple of months when the market sort of hit some lows, right? At that time, June or something like that.  buy low, etc. But when you look at the mutual funds one, what you\\'re trying to look at is what\\'s been there in general performance and how do they perform when the market goes down. I mean, that\\'s one of the parameters that I look at. The same thing goes with small case also. I think they give you that backtesting and those graphs as well. So you can just move those around very basic. I don\\'t do a structured analysis, but you can understand that if the market is falling or the index is falling by this much, what is the net-net impact usually on this and how much they rebalance.  critical and if that is not what something you have confidence with you don\\'t at all invest in it see i i mean i don\\'t do short term i mean short term investing is the stock funds that you invest in equity right but apart from that mutual funds i am i\\'m hopefully investing for the long term i mean i don\\'t have any liabilities i don\\'t have to uh do any immediate spending per se so my thing is that you know gonna be keep gonna keep on investing in them for the long run as  When you look at your financial planning, of course, that is the first homework everyone should be doing. So, you know, what are your goals and, you know, what actually you want to reach, where you want to reach. And then you decide a vehicle, you know, like, you know, I want to go this and I want to achieve this amount. So, this is the path. Yeah. So, it is a short-term thing. It is a long-term thing. So, based on that, you know, you pick one thing. Like, for example, small case is something for long-term. Equity is something for long-term. But, of course, there are mutual funds that I have picked for,  So I\\'m just compounding. So basically when I decide a product before the financial planning is important. And whenever I pick, like for example, how I research Wintwell. So I first do, you know, like the way you guys already doing, you know, showing interviews and everything, you know, making sure that the product is safe in some regards. So, you know, and then I started with very small step.  you know, like for example, I, I hear, I also want to mention Strata where I\\'m doing my real estate investment and their software, the web panel that they have designed. It\\'s so intuitive and very, very like recently they\\'ve even launched the mobile app. So that\\'s where, uh, went well, uh, have launched their mobile app, but that\\'s only for Android right now, not iPhone users. So I\\'m waiting for that. So basically that makes your life easy, you know, because you feel connected and, uh, you know, you can, uh, you can see your investment whenever,  how I\\'m tracking it, what kind of reports and what kind of updates I\\'m getting. Then the customer support. Again, I really feel that customer support is very important because you sometimes have queries and you want to get sorted out. For example, recently when I got one of the investment get returned and the amount was the principal and interest was clubbed together.  in your bank statement. So it makes easier your life. This is the interest and this is the principle that you get. So that makes your life easy. Why? Because you have so many entries in your bank statement and sometimes it was easy to track. So basically these kind of stuff. So again, to summarize, product is based on the financial planning. I can\\'t say that differs from person to person. But once you know the product and you want to invest, I prefer to start with small.  if you have anything to add to it and what do you look for and what is very critical for you? So, as I said that my prime investment is to secure a sustained income. So, any product which can bring sustained income and can be reassuring to the investor. I mean, it\\'s like if I am able to  objective also. Yes, sir. Whatever income generation can be there, sustained income generation, any variation of the product will be there. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Ranjit, sir, would you like to add something? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, I\\'ve seen Vintual these testing with different assets, like they are repaying like three months, six months, one year.  uh uh origin is a big like three to five years you can increase the origin if we get the interest we can add some money and we can like again invest into this small little bit of asset classes that will be useful because we are recurring investment in the interval if you have some large large ticket of asset when we can invest that asset and we can get the repayment for every month we can add some amount and we can  if it is withdrawable at least within six months of span at least a part of the fund uh i will for sure be on it and that\\'s why in my portfolio i keep uh those elss part a little lower than the the liquid ones so and hence wind has also given me that opportunity because you could take some part out every six months and then this also helps you to go a little more on your investment value because when you have liquidity you could put a little more in and then second thing is the tool itself for example  you so you know gold bonds you know mutual funds you know bonds in general so let\\'s uh personify them like uh if i meet you for the first time how would uh you introduce them to me as friends uh for example uh like equity i had a gentleman saying that oh he\\'s like a fun rock star i don\\'t trust him but he\\'s my friend for a long time and he\\'s just like ranveer singh he dresses flashy and for  Yeah, bonds are like elder brother that kind of thing. Because he\\'s guiding and he can care about like survey as well as any backups in there, they are ready to support us. That\\'s kind of, you know, bonds are related to, it\\'s like a brother kind of thing. Okay, and equity mutual funds and gold bonds, how would you say both of them? Equity kind of thing, you need,  gold bonds and bonds in general like these two people I think say you\\'re on mute so I was saying gold and gold bonds and bonds you know gold bonds basically I\\'m more like SGB friend so SGBs and bonds are kind of you know kind of I would say test matches so you just believe they are good you know  monthly rebalance kind of. So you just sit aside and, you know, enjoying your small cases, how they are doing it, you know, and they\\'re really doing great. Kind of. Yeah. So small case is your friend that you kind of have, you sit with him on a weekend, have long conversations. Right. And how is Gold Bond as your friend and how different is he from Bond in general? Like an SGB different from a Bond in general? That\\'s a very big difference. Bond is like, you know,  nowadays SGB is also giving you interest so that\\'s again a different way of getting meditation sort of and gold bond is again I will I feel like you know wind wealth till now the journey has been very very short so but till now I am really enjoying it so I would say I feel safe and again it\\'s kind of where there is no kind of fluctuation lot of fluctuations and kind of you are kind of a  a friend with you, you are kind of excited. That gives an excitement that, you know, chilling in a more different way. Yeah. Ashwin, sir, you can, you want to add anything now or you would still kind of pass it off? I mean, as everyone mentioned, equity is more like those friends who, you know, quite, how would I say it?  Okay. Thanks, Ashwin. Aditya, anything you want to ask? Yeah, I wanted to ask you. I mean, I\\'m not sure if this is the right forum, but I recently read that news on, I don\\'t know if you saw the hit piece on The Ken, right? And I was a bit shaken by that. Did you see the hit piece that Ken has written on Mint Wealth? Or no? Maybe I\\'ll find you guys later. I will definitely check that out. And that was a bit discerning.  are like financial rock stars. So like half of my work is done there. But I would want to understand your opinions and your needs and how these assets are for you. So just give me a moment and let me know if my screen is visible. Siddharth, is my screen visible?  I have a few assets here. One is your sovereign gold bonds, which you guys have, which I think Manish sir has already mentioned about. Then debt mutual funds, which all of you are kind of aware about. Then tax-free bonds and FD aggregation and arbitrage funds. So there\\'s a brief description on it. What kind of interest and returns you would expect? What are the taxation policies around it? What are the risk and loss?  you you  I think Ashwin is good to go. Aditya sir, Manish sir. Aditya sir, Manish sir, is everything good to go? Yeah, yeah. Okay.  I accept tax-free bonds. I believe I have every investment type. I have arbitrage bonds. I do have FDs. I do have debt mutual fund and I do have SGBs. But your rank one, like your... One, okay, okay. Because, you know, every investment have a different purpose. Like, for example, arbitrage fund, you know, for like, you know, I have park money for, you know, the money that I do need for next couple of years for at least one or two years.  I would say in terms of returns, because that is one of the parameters that everyone sees. So I would go with Dapp Mutual Fund, number one, because that\\'s again a good thing and I feel that gives a good return. Again, not for short term. You need some kind of three years horizon at least. I will just spark you up on second right now. I just want to kind of get your opinion on the first one. I\\'ll definitely come back to you.  would reduce down to more stable like tax-free bonds or FD aggregation. And Ajit, these are your thoughts, your number one pick. To be honest, currently I only invest in debt mutual funds for now. I mean, I don\\'t understand what FD aggregation is. If it just means FDs, then yes, I do that as well. But I don\\'t do this with 5 lakh government guarantee. I don\\'t know how this is happening. But yeah, I mean, the one I would go with right now  I can\\'t say no to arbitrage funds, but I haven\\'t gotten around to parking money in them yet, to be honest. But the other ones are very, very, very long term. I feel the tax-free bonds and sovereign bond, the sovereign gold bonds, maybe if there\\'s another crisis globally, then I\\'ll put money in them. Not right now, yeah. Yeah, and Ashwin sir, like other good-to-have kind of a product and one you would say that it\\'s like, okay, it\\'s a good-to-have  like any particular thing? Somehow the whole concept is somehow doesn\\'t look fascinating to me at the first place. I understand it\\'s a rare earth metal which has some value at the moment and people are trading that rare earth metal for a long time. But somehow I cannot connect with sovereign gold bonds for some reason. No justifications as such. No, no, no. I just wanted your opinion around it. Money is,  these two not other three because you know they are not really again they all FDs of course not an investment according to me that\\'s just for parking money for a certain emergency sort of thing and tax refunds again no low return so I would go with some other class other asset class so I will I haven\\'t done and I am not exploring that and arbitrage fund again that was again a parking thing which is you know I have a very specific goal that is why I am using that but if I do  like five, six of these products on one single platform. Do you think your life would become easier if, you know, kind of things would be easier for you? What would be our expectations around it? Sure, of course, if everything, like, you know, for example, arbitrage funds already are on, you know, basically a type of mutual fund. So, arbitrage fund is already, like, you know, someone is already investing money on a particular, because nowadays everyone is utilizing,  where they already have money available. I\\'m not talking about corporate FDs. I\\'m talking about bank FDs right now. Tax-free bonds, again, of course, yes, tax-free bonds make sense because there is no ideal place available right now. Of course, they are, I think, one of the platforms from Zerodha provides a platform for having one platform for all kinds of bonds. But the only platform I know. Debt mutual fund, the same story like arbitrage fund. Again, if I\\'m already connected with and I\\'m doing my direct  using uh uh uh zerodha for that okay and and how\\'s your experience been so far considering it\\'s very easy like you know like buying a stock uh buying any stock you know you just go and pick the sgps of course i\\'m using some calculators available on internet that gives you what are the sgps having a high volume available and what kind of discounts available right now i pick that uh sgp and i go on the market and buy that particular okay okay and uh  We have one tool called Grip, where we have invoice discounting, I think real estate investment and startup in one. So it does not feel it\\'s bifurcated because at the end, the company wants to give customers the options to choose from. I would have two opinions about this. I would either want to have a tool or a company or a product which lets me invest in all of this in one place. Or as one of the colleagues was earlier mentioning, if at all we could monitor all the investments at one place with some other tool, also it would help.  right so even your platform giraffe and pillow and everywhere you can log on and see individually but if there exists something where you know you can make it a one-stop shop and then maybe i might even be influenced to stop investing else in there because of the comfort maybe yeah right okay uh thank you sir for your time i\\'ll just take a few minutes more uh this is more from the lens of wind and how we can kind of come back to it how can we make experience  the experience is really good the only feedback like i said two feedback that i already shared with the team uh one is like ios app which is uh i got updated and second is like you know uh some kind of reporting where because you know like the way i got uh you know a kind of return in my bank account and i got confused though i got clarified immediately by the by the customer support and it was really helpful but ultimately you know because you know there are so many  money that you have found in you know with windfans so that is the that is the area yeah uh uh sir your thoughts yeah i can i can jump in right so yeah uh to be honest uh i mean i have invested post that but i think i i mentioned before right that that hit piece and i think sidhan shared that article from linden as well but uh but yeah i think in general what the platforms like  back, it sort of builds that confidence as well. That\\'s the positive reinforcement that I would love to keep ongoing as well. And the second bit was, I think maybe this is a miss on my understanding, but the dashboard has been updated as well. Because earlier it used to show only the invested amount and the fund amount irrespective of what\\'s been returned, etc. Thank you.  they are with three years, five years. Same way you can promote as well as who is with Winter Wealth. Like three years the customers is with Winter Wealth. You can give the appreciations as well as you can post in social media that will be create a culture. Right. Right. Right. Definitely. Definitely we\\'ll kind of your opinions and your employee centricity and investor centricity is something which is very critical and close to heart. So,  any value you think we should have for the future as well i would say the trust trust of the customers so i would say even if i mean personal opinion even if one payment defaults or even if one payment does not come on time as per the expectation what is shown on the website then the customer would think twice before he puts in the large chunk in so uh there are two aspects because this happened to me with one other platform the the payments were delayed by a day or two and then i  but customer support is also one of the part. I need to expect from near future because if the asset like investors keep on increasing the customer\\'s support will divert there. No need to like neglect this part. Sure, sir. In the previous part also you mentioned about all the platforms in the wind well that kind of thing which is  Well, I just want to say I\\'m in line with what Ashwin has said. So trust is something, one of the parameters which I think we should be in line. Right. So thank you for giving your valuable time on Saturday. I think I was just short five minutes over both than your time. I know it\\'s Saturday. It\\'s a holiday and you wouldn\\'t want to spend it. You would rather spend it with your family.  Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Bye. Thank you, Kapil. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Have a nice weekend. Same here. Yo. Yeah, everyone\\'s gone. Yeah. What do you think, man? Better than the last one? Way better. That\\'s a call. Hey, stop recording. That\\'s a>transcript_1: < you  you  Let me check. Send me the numbers with their name. I\\'ll call. Give me one second. Also, I\\'ll ask you after the JSON thing. I have some questions I\\'ll ask after this call. Okay. We\\'ll just handle.  कपिल मैं मेकिंग यू द वह एक बार नहीं है अब यह जाएगा अब यह जाएगा अब यह जाएगा  एक और नितेश आया है ओके तो कोई है नहीं टू पीपल आर देर इन अवेटिंग ओके तो सेधान अमेज़ सेंडिंग यू एन एक्सेल चीफ इन पर जिंग आपको मैसेज कर दो इसके लिए  Hello. Hello, Nitesh. Piyush. Am I audible? Hello. Yeah, yeah, you\\'re audible. I was just setting up my speakers. No, no, no, no. Hi. Is it just possible that if you can keep your camera on so it\\'s easier for me to kind of connect? Sure. Hey, thanks, Piyush. Hi, Nitesh.  Just give us a few minutes and we\\'ll start.  you  Nitish Piyush, first of all, I would like to kind of thank you for giving us the time and joining us. And we really value your opinion. And I\\'m Kapil and the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better and how we at Wint can improve your experience. So there are no right or wrong answers. You can express your views very freely here. No one\\'s here to judge you.  It is a start.  I mean, I just have an icebreaker with each one of you. So I\\'ll just start with myself so I can understand you better. My name is Kapil and my hobbies are playing and watching football and getting to know about a lot of worldviews through books. If Piyush, Nitesh,  are you playing these days? So I recently got Xbox. So like I recently downloaded Mortal Kombat 11. I play FIFA and then Halo Infinite Assassin\\'s Creed. I\\'m more of a PlayStation person. Interesting to see Xbox people. Yeah. Nitesh, if you can help me about  So Nitesh, have you bought any DSLR? Yeah, I have one Nikon G7500 with me. Okay. Any plans to buy a mirrorless DSLR? No, not at the moment because I just bought my DSLR about two years back and it\\'s fairly new. I haven\\'t used it quite much. And even at that time, I was contemplating whether to buy a mirrorless or a older version DSLR.  Okay, so let\\'s just start. I don\\'t want to waste your time since you\\'ve just given, like you\\'ve taken the time out on a working day. I\\'m really grateful for that. So I\\'ll just start ahead and kind of understand what investment products you kind of invest in. I do stocks, crypto, bonds, gold bonds. So what kind of products you invest in?  and leave it so it depends on product okay so just a follow-up uh do you have any allocation for like a fixed income uh products or high-risk products like equity like you have a fixed allocation like i have a 60 40 allocation um you know currently i don\\'t have that fixed allocation i just go with whichever is giving me higher returns okay i i saw this trend of me  I have not invested in REIT as of now. But apart from that, I invest directly in stocks, equity funds and bonds as well. And specifically through WinkWealth because I haven\\'t tried any other platform to invest in bonds. Okay. Yeah. And like, do you, like, where do you get fixed returns and fixed annual? Like, do you have any allocation for it? Or do you do it goal-based?  and all. So the extra money that I have is going into bonds which went with offers rather than going directly into stocks. Okay, so you mentioned SIP and that is a regular process, right? Every month you invest some money in it. So I want to understand that when you put money in regular investment products, like what kind of things do you look for like?  turnover portfolio, long-term view. And I like those kinds of funds, but recently I have also been into a bit of, uh, quant funding investing. Okay. So I also believe that quant funds have the capacity to outperform the market. So I have also begun investing in quant funds and a good track record is what I look into before investing.  a bet on it but if i go for something like hgb or the bonds i will see the returns and over what period so how much period will it take me to yield because uh there is this thing new uh which is peer-to-peer uh liquid equivalents or liquid ones that cred offers which also provides similar uh similar  what time I will get a proper return, like in which period I will get a proper return. So I just keep it there, like over time it will grow. Okay. So you mentioned liquidity, you mentioned returns, you mentioned period. But if I would ask you to choose one thing when this is very critical, when you look for, when you invest in products, so what would that be? I would say one thing, the first most thing that I look for is returns.  tenure should be low or the rate of return should be high enough to compensate for that. Okay. So that\\'s what I decided. Okay. So if a product with higher risk, lower risk and higher tenure comes in, you\\'re pretty fine with such products? Yeah, but the tenure should not be too long as the visibility is kind of dicey. Okay.  understand the risk and return. And you invest in so many products and you are investment savvy and you are a CEO, you have great knowledge of financial products. So I want to understand that which is that one favorite product which you really like in all the investment. Might be bond, might be equity, might be good bonds or real estate. So I want to understand what is that one favorite  Asset plus has the history of beating the inflation over longer horizon. And that\\'s what excites me. I mean, other products also have the capacity, but they do not outperform inflation as much as equity does, in my opinion. So I prefer equity over the others. Okay. And Piyush, that product which you really like,  One for different purposes. Like I like small cases for equity because it takes my overhead of researching and I am able to invest in a proper portfolio. I don\\'t need to manage each stock by myself. So I like small case. Then I like WinkWealth for bonds because I feel it\\'s very simple to understand. Everything is provided very in descriptive manner.  three top most but it seems like you\\'re looking at products which give you a very hassle free experience is that your yes side or so when you look so what is more critical hassle free experience or the returns you look at both so all these products give me a good returns like they do like for example if you take  fixed guarantee. So even if I get default, it\\'s a covered loan. So at least my principal won\\'t get hampered even if I lose out on the returns. So keeping it hassle-free and also keeping good in returns. So that is what because I don\\'t come from a finance background. And when I tried going in it, I felt it\\'s a web of things like you know one thing, then you try to learn another thing and the third and the fourth and then everything is interconnected.  bonds gold bonds sgbs as a product and bonds in general as a product so like how would you introduce them to me as friends right if let\\'s say a small case was your friend uh and i met you for the first time how would you introduce uh it to me and what would he wear what kind of personality he would be uh if you can start to use on let\\'s say small cases gold bonds and bonds  forward to creating a portfolio. So as a person, yeah. So as a person, like he\\'s good with portfolio management as a person, he is, uh, I would say, no, uh, easy example, right? Equity. Uh, one of the users said that, okay, equity is like Ranveer Singh. He\\'s funny. He\\'s quirky. He\\'s unpredictable. Uh,  it is like Cheteshwar Pujara like he bats for long five days and it is not the best strike rate in the market but yeah it is that dependable person so Nitish sir if you want to kind of meanwhile Piyush is thinking around Nitish sir if you want to kind of help me with that small case SGB and bonds yeah even I am thinking of some corrective  like Harvey Specter from Suits. So they have everything for everyone, like for every scenario, whatever portfolio you want to make, they will have something around it in and around it. And they prove them like, how do you trust it? You trust it by the managers who are managing that portfolio and also by the thesis or the, you can call it  We\\'re going to L3B.  like the managers and producers, everybody knows them, but not too many people talk about them. And SGBs are like the blackened people, the light men, the cameramen, who we do not know them, we do not see them, but if they do not do their job, then the film will not come out. So just like SGBs, they\\'re not only tax-free if we hold them till the end of maturity, but they also provide as a hedge against inflation.  Vint will would be the kind of an actor who prefers specific kind of roles. Okay, so the so that it becomes predictable. Any examples? Let\\'s say  table that James Bond character is associated with action movies and equities are small case so if I try to since small case I mean small case as a product or as a proxy as a film actor or a character like James Bond is a character so what do you think?  Whereas the bonds offered from Wintwell is a little offbeat. Like it\\'s covered bonds. Not everyone offers it. It\\'s not easily available, but it\\'s something that Wintwell does well. And with Steve, sorry, with Michael Scott, it\\'s like once you assign him a task, he will do it somehow or the other. So once you invest in bonds, it\\'s like you will get your money after the period. You can\\'t, like there is option to withdraw,  like Michael Scott, I feel. And Nidhi sir, have you thought something about small case? No, I\\'m blank at the moment. Okay, no worries. What I\\'ll do is I\\'ll share my screen. Just let me know if it\\'s visible. There are various products on the screen, various proposition of these products. I want to kind of gauge your opinion towards these products.  Okay. Yeah. So I\\'ll just give a brief of this. There are various products, sovereign gold bonds, debt mutual funds, tax-free bonds, FDA aggregators and arbitrage funds. So you might be aware of them or you might be already investing a few of them, but just for the sake of it, we\\'ve given what is a description, what kind of returns are expected on these products  Thank you.  which of these products you feel are like good to have in my portfolio right there are some products that i will say that okay these are good i don\\'t want in my portfolio and there are some products like two three products i choose for my portfolio so what what of these products you find are good to have in your portfolio for me sgp and get funds are good to have  So, SGB first of all is linked to the gold prices. So, and gold historically has had lower correlation with equities and it acts as a natural hedge to your equity portfolio. Okay. And apart from that, we get additional 2.5% per annum on the issue price as well as there is no tax if we hold till maturity. So, that\\'s what makes it  a must have like this so i must have between us a gold bond or a debt mutual fund which one would you kind of prefer it\\'s difficult to choose because i personally i would prefer both we cannot keep a very high allocation for sgb because it may not perform well in the time frame that we are holding it  So they have more than 5% return and virtually no risk. Okay. So it\\'s like a fixed return and their returns are more than SGB. So like even after tax, it\\'s still greater than that. And it\\'s even after tax greater than FDs. So it\\'s still a better option, even if I have to pay taxes. And there is,  say if you had to choose kind of between FD aggregator and arbitrage fund what would you kind of say is the must have or the better in your product in your eyes amongst these two yeah I don\\'t know FD aggregation looks better because it has a tax exemption like a TDS exemption limit and then it  what are your thoughts on such a platform? Like what is your expectations this platform will give and what is critical that this platform should not miss? Sorry, I did not get your question. I\\'ll repeat my question. I\\'ll let this to you to kind of begin with. So if a platform comes, let\\'s say a website or a new app,  we can skip the description for now because anyone who is investing must be knowing basic about what he\\'s investing into the asset class. So that is something that is not that critical, I would say. But I would say interest on principle, the taxation and risk, all the three are critical. Additional notes is again not so critical because it\\'s additional. No, it\\'s just for your reference. Let\\'s say there\\'s one app which you can see all these products as. I\\'ll just show you an example.  in one single place where there would be HDBs, listed bonds, fixed deposit, debt mutual funds, arbitrage funds, where on this platform you can buy and sell securities, avail credit against an investment and hedge risk against your other equipments like an equity or a crypto. So what do you think is your expectations from such a platform from an ease of point of view considering you look at ease of point of view and returns, what do you expect  So having the basket, then proper segregation, like this is the bond and so much percent of it is going, so much percent of it is going here and so much percent is the SGP and stuff. And then it will give you returns so by so, like there are some that will give you in six months that will mature in a year and so, and something like on those lines. So making it clear for me, like what returns I should expect over what period of time.  that as a platform. Then it\\'s very normal actually. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I interrupted you. I was just saying that then it feels like just another aggregator platform, I would say for bonds. Okay. And what would you expect from such an aggregator platform? And what is very critical that this aggregator should not miss?  sense in terms of one because it\\'s a one-time thing i don\\'t need to go to my laptop every time for that one-time investment uh except except that i would say uh yeah just the simple ui basically everything in front of you you can access all the parts of it browse through it good discoverability i would say this having a good discoverability because uh  offering would be a great product. I think there are multiple points that I can think of. So, first of all, since there are a lot of products available to invest, so it will be a one-stop shop where we can invest as well as track all our investments in these products. So, it would be a really great platform. Also,  different site and then compare and then come back to coin right so that\\'s the issue with the coin platform it\\'s great to invest and track but not to compare the available options where we can choose based on our requirements it provides very few features so having such a future where we can compare would be critical another aspect would be that since such a product offers multiple assets to invest in  in the upcoming year or so if possible. Statements which will help us in our tax filings etc. Right. Okay. Thanks, Nitish. I\\'ll just take a couple of few more questions and you have given me such great answers, such great thoughts to ponder too. So one, I would like to understand your perception about us as Vintwell. What do you think are good aspects? What do you think are our shortcomings?  and I was part of it. So I\\'m quite associated with WinkWealth from the start of WinkWealth\\'s journey. And it really filled a void in the bond space where individuals did not invest too much in bonds or they did not know too much about bonds specifically to say. So WinkWealth has helped to bridge the investment gap as well as the knowledge gap on both fronts.  So I had a call with one of the members about two or three weeks back. And there also I have given my feedback that WinkWealth offers bonds in the space where the bond duration is ranging from one to four years. Okay. So if we have to invest in high yielding products, which are less than one year, there is no option which WinkWealth currently provides. Of course, there are some products.  as we build more and more bonds, it becomes a bit difficult to keep track of all bonds. So if we get a consolidated view of all our investments on the platform, like when are the next repayments coming in, how much cash is going to come in the next six months, so that we can plan accordingly, that would be a great feature addition. Definitely, definitely. And views are what I are things to say about the good, bad and the ugly.  That is the ugly for me. Otherwise, the scope for improvement, as Nitesh said, I really like the idea of having that cash flow prediction. So like when I invest in bonds, I do see that the returns, expected returns, you just select how many bonds, how many slots you are taking. And it shows you that this much interest you will get after this much time, after three months, after six months, whatever is the bond maturity time.  we have to do to kind of get your trust more or get your help you invest more so this is this is not directly a feedback that i\\'m giving but something that i\\'m facing so i see you have you have this refer and earn reference system but i have felt this from my personal experience that whenever i recommend someone to invest in bonds  stuff about bond assets, I think that would be helpful. Definitely, we\\'ll take your feedback into account. Would you want to add anything to it? What things we can do to improve your experience? How would we help you invest more? When people look at bonds,  follow-up question to both of you right you just said people perception do you think it\\'s like people don\\'t see bonds in the right way or they don\\'t trust that enough or is that impacts your decision is that something which you feel is happening like when I started investing in crypto my father said what what the hell are you doing why you\\'re kind of wasting money or why are you so brash and same thing  or do you think it is very complex as a system compared to an equity? I think it is education and also that leads to the lack of knowledge of the asset. Yeah, lack of knowledge I think would be because people invest in FDs which is a fixed income product but they do not invest in bonds as much. I mean, they do not even have a small exposure.  are even worse than FDs. That was my personal experience with those. Like I invested in 2, 3 and the returns were really bad. Like 3, 4%. Really bad. And when I saw Wintwell then I was like why to have that mutual fund when I can directly get debt bonds which does the same thing which plays the same role in my portfolio having some debt and giving me way greater returns anyway.  So I just assume that there is no exit and then I invest, which makes things easier for me. But it\\'s worth the extra returns that I\\'m getting in the same amount of time. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Nitsi sir, would you like to add something or I\\'m done at my end? But if you want to kind of add anything, any problems or challenges you\\'re currently facing at Vint and is there something I can do to help and kind of connect you there?  something of marketplace on wind wealth itself so you go and just like today I want to buy some bonds I think this would also help Nitish in the scenario where he told he wants liquidity in below less than one year so he can just go see the available bonds on the marketplace who wants an exit he\\'ll just buy their bonds and give them exit right now and he also will get exit below one year  and I don\\'t know whether it\\'s a win-12 send or some other issue but I have invested in a few bonds and some bonds are reflected in my zero that is kite app but others are not visible on the app so I have to go to the dp website to check whether I really have them in my team up or not  some demand like for example zero that do not show it on your uh on their app but you can uh just verify it on the chdl app and you will see it in your demand so it is in your demand but they don\\'t show because it is not listed on the exchange no okay because even i have my recent bonds are not showing and i traced this query with windwell team and this is what i came to know no okay yeah yeah i can see  every time. Definitely. Definitely. So I would like to thank you all for your time. You\\'ve given me an hour on a Tuesday, which is a working day. I really appreciate the efforts and the valuable discussion we had. And I hope that Winfield had come to your life and did something. So really thankful for your time and insights and discussions and your patience as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.>transcript_2: < Wow.  कर रहा है कि यह अरे क्या है यार सब यूजर कॉल में देखेंगे वह नहीं है कपेल स्क्रीबिंग नहीं नहीं वह यह मल्टिपल रिकॉर्डिंग्स तीए सेंड आपके यूजर वाले अच्छा लास्ट वन वास क्वाइड इंट्रेस्टिंग आई थिंग देवर मोर वाइड इनवेस्टेड इन एसजीबी देवर मोर वॉमर टू वाटेड मूचल फांड पर लोंग थर्म ओराइजन एंड रिस्ट मिटिगेशन अच्छा तो वह शोड़ अपने  लेट मी सी और अजय को अगर नहीं हो पाया लेकिन इस पेटिंग टेंड फिर दो लोग आ गए नियुक्त  Hello, am I audible?

So first of all, thank you for joining with us. And we really value your opinion towards Vintwell. I\\'m Kapil and I look at research and insights at Vintwell. Now the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better and how Vint can improve your experience. So there are no right and wrong answers.  myself and I would want to understand everyone better. So I\\'ll just start my name is Kapil and I work in insights and my hobbies is watching football, playing FIFA and reading books. So if you can let me just know your name and what are your hobbies currently Rajsekar sir and then Mithun sir.  So this interaction is also a result of my investment strategy and link with VendWealth. Okay. That\\'s about me. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Nitin sir, can you help me? I know you\\'re a family guy and I\\'m taking a Saturday and quality time with your family. It looks like quite a fun loving guy you must be. So you\\'re muted.  So yeah, what do you see? But yeah, just let\\'s start. Yeah, I\\'ve been in IT, but predominantly been in technology for financial services, right? And that\\'s probably the first place where 20 years back, I got into all of the nuances of financial services, right? So I got an opportunity to work for a lot of financial services and then payments and all of that, right?  idea of wind wealth right and maybe another reason which I came to know later is Ajinkya and I both are from Nasik right so that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s an after effect I would say yeah he\\'s probably missing Nasik from the office so I just want now you\\'ve spoken a lot about investment products and investment strategy so I just want to understand what kind of products have you invested in what kind of products you know about just in so  And then I went on for one more. And then after that, finally, I found this guy who basically was heading Ameriprise. And then he\\'s my financial advisor. And I do all my financials and I call all my financials through goals. So I\\'m not really looking at investing because I want to invest. So I had life goals through which we worked through that. We figured out a strategy of what we want to do, the kind of products.  through wind to earth. That\\'s probably how I\\'ve been managing. And Rajesh sir, how do you go about with the various products you have and you\\'re aware of and where do you invest in? You\\'re asking me, right? Yes, sir. I do extensive investment. Okay. My portfolio is quite huge and I touch from everything, right from fixed deposits,  citizen or a government backed bonds even if it is a bit less and also I do tax-free bonds to some extent to avoid tax. So wind-weld as I was telling one good thing is it\\'s an innovative idea because all cannot invest 10 lakhs in one bond because all the good bonds which are more secured and comparatively more secured and yield is fairly good they come  genuine feedback. Sometimes we are not able to really assess the quality of the bonds because so many bonds are coming these days and the bonds details are very what you call abridged. It is not very detailed. So probably sometimes we skip some of the bonds. We are not so sure because even if you  equity portfolio, it\\'s pretty difficult to figure out which bond. I\\'ll give you my simple way I try to do. There was one bond that came from one of the NBFC that\\'s promoted by Slice. I figured out they are predominantly into your BNPL, which is sort of unsecured. Then I skipped that bond. I skipped that bond predominantly because it is something you\\'re doing in unsecured lending.  But then, you know, pretty much something like size A, I would probably avoid because I really don\\'t know how to evaluate that portfolio and, you know, understand what the risk is. Yeah. Thank you, sir, for giving us this feedback. Kind of helps us understand your evaluation on various things. But I would definitely give this as a feedback to my team. But let\\'s just start with me understanding you better.  said by time of your Saturday. So I would, I\\'m actually thankful that you gave me some time on Saturday, but I just wanted to understand first that what are your investment products, which you are aware of and where do you invest in, in general? Yeah. So I started like two to three years back. So I did this course from BSC Bombay Stock Exchange from where I got to know about stocks and equities and more. So after that,  fell into debt also. So yeah, equities and debt. It\\'s great you mentioned equity and debt because that\\'s my next question. Basically, I wanted to understand how do you kind of invest in like my strategies, I pay all my bills, then I kind of have certain investments amount to make and then I have a fixed allocation which I\\'ll make in equity, I have a fixed allocation I\\'ll make in debt. So you do that or do you think okay, now the market\\'s down,  then I do the expenditures. So I follow that. Okay. And like, I have a 60-40 kind of a balance, like 60 in equity, 40 in debt. My father has an opposite kind of a mindset of having 60 in debt, 40 in equity. So like how much do you put in equity and how much do you put in debt? Roughly, if I would say so, so 65% in equities and others, like in other assets, gold and debt. Okay. So gold you buy physical?  project, it\\'s saying, you know, what\\'s the amount I need, and then work that out with my risk profile to get me an understanding of what kind of savings I need to do, right. And that was that was basically a mix of mix of products, right. So for me, it\\'s not as much around, you know, an equity versus debt. For me, it\\'s about the goal, right. So if I were to give you an idea, when we started off, right, maybe 2016 is when, you know, we went big way, it was it was roughly 70% into anything equity oriented.  That was the time when we decided that probably some time-sensitive goals need some more questioning. That\\'s probably where we went with the child plan for insurance. So that was basically for my daughter\\'s education. So that\\'s basically how I generally go ahead and do it. So for me, the goal is more important than probably just a strategy. Sure, definitely. And Raja sir, how do you go about with your investment?  when you take a holistic view of the investment picture. So I do keep something in income generation investments, some in what you call short-term maturing ones so that I can divert the equity if required or put it back here in bonds, liquid bonds or whatever it is. So the remaining 10% will be in mutual fund bonds. It also includes your wind wealth bonds and  look at the past performance, reviews, delivery time. But for me, the most critical is that the delivery time should be the shortest. So like similarly for investment products, I\\'ll start with you, Rajasthan. Like what are the different thoughts you have and what do you critically look for that, okay, this should be there, so I\\'ll invest in any new product. Okay, I slightly differ from you in terms of the,  the catching point is the return on investment. Everybody will agree that we are looking for a decent return on investment and of course without compromising on the security of your investment. So these two go in parallel. You cannot compromise one for another. So that is the main thing. And the second thing is when the product is launched then there is a  So when you talk about the investment through wind well, probably sometimes as I said earlier, there is some lack of information about decision to make an investment because of lack of clarity on the complete picture. So second thing is, as I look at the reissue of the bonds again, see you have a repayment  out from collecting from the depositors again giving it back for the repayment so if the cycle goes you know then probably we do not know really whether things are going in the right way so first sir i i would definitely assure you that our we have a very stringent risk team and the risk team will look into the marriage demerits of each asset and each issue as well and then only bring it on our platform  company activities and how Mint Wealth is securing the investment of the investors. What are the controls they have to monitor the asset quality and coverage? Sure, sure, sir. Definitely. So Kapila, I think from my perspective, because I\\'m pretty much goal-driven, I look at the product as to how does it fit into my entire strategy. So what I basically try and do, and I\\'ll give an example.  but more predictable. And then that\\'s where we went with that insurance product. So for me, one of the things that predominant is where does it fit into my entire strategy. That\\'s probably one of the key things that I look at. As I said, the reason I was accepted to a twin 12 was it was filling that gap between FD and the mutual fund. We could very well say that, hey, there are debt mutuals.  loaning that money to, right? And then there is, you know, some more amount of public information available for me to go behind this and then kind of figure out what\\'s happening, right? So for me, it\\'s important that from my strategy perspective, where is it actually fitting into, right? And that\\'s probably, you know, one of the key factors for me. And then as Raj sir said, obviously, from a platform perspective, not from a product perspective, but from a platform perspective, given that we are retail investors, right? We may not have  to figure out that if somebody is able to do that due diligence for us and then bring that up, that just cuts down on the time that we need to spend. So now it\\'s basically more of decision to say, okay, whether I buy it or not. And that is more driven by maybe the team of the company. So as I said, probably slice I skipped because I was not very much interested in doing something that is BNP. So that\\'s how I look at it from both perspectives. From a product perspective, where does it fit into my strategy?  that okay someone is actively looking it on your behalf and then if there is a value I don\\'t mind paying fee for you know getting that value right and and Jatin sir your thoughts on what are the different things you look for and what is the most critical aspect for you yeah so I thought about wind wealth I told that to you I\\'ll come back to wind wealth later on I\\'ll just yeah just focus on what I\\'ve been like when you buy  due diligence and all process. So it\\'s actually not possible if I say so for us to do that also due diligence and all. Because at a retailer and retail investors say it\\'s weak. I don\\'t think so we can do that actually. And that 2% of the share which went well invest in all the assets like I have heard that in some of the meetings.  bonds as your friend think of equity mutual funds or small cases as your friend and think think of just small cases as a friend debt debt products like a bond as your friend and gold as a friend right so how would you interest introduce them to me like for example if someone\\'s telling equity like equity products he will say he\\'s my friend for long but he\\'s unpredictable he\\'s like an  I probably instantly I was able to connect it with our ages, right? Because the way you said it, right? Is basically, you know, take a look at gold and that\\'s like your grandparents, right? I mean, something that\\'s strong, sturdy experience won\\'t let you down, right? That\\'s probably how I would look at gold, right? Mutual fund is what you look at your parents, right? Who are trying to balance it, right? As much as they  should I go with WintMelt or not, right? I knew why that product was right. From a WiltMelt perspective, I\\'m still trying to figure out, right? How do I put that into my portfolio, right? And at the time I told him, right, that I am doing to understand it much better, right? I\\'m not really doing it from a portfolio perspective, right? At the end of the day, like Rath sir said, right, because the information is less, because the product is not as tradable as the other product.  at the various ranges of all the assets. So just one more follow-up question, Nitin sir. So would you think of gold as your grandparents, as you have said, who are safe, secure? But do you think gold bonds are in the same category or you would define gold bonds as differently? I probably will keep them somewhere the same, right? Because at the  plus some additional person. So yeah, I would say they are still part of that senior citizens family for me. Okay. And Raj sir, how would you determine all these products as people or as characters or as sports athletes? This is a very tough question because for me as a long-time investor, the ground situation will keep changing every time. Right. So sometimes,  that\\'s how i make a call uh sometimes you may fail even in the judgment but uh you cannot keep quiet you have to make your dynamic changes right based on the driving forces in the market right right uh jatin sir your thoughts uh how how do you perceive them yeah like for bonds i can think of like it\\'s some summer friend which i don\\'t meet like  but you don\\'t actually meet but when you meet it\\'s like you really have a good time so right for equities i can say it\\'s like a dancer or a cyclist because you know there are some cycles in that okay i don\\'t really actually don\\'t know no no that\\'s completely fine it\\'s just your perception on things what i do right now is uh so what i do is i share my screen i  Yeah, is my screen visible? Yeah, can see that. So here is a list of assets. What I\\'ve done is there are different products. What are the descriptions? What is the interest or returns you get? What are the taxation policies around it? What is the risk? And if there\\'s anything additional which we want to add, I think we can, like that\\'s what we\\'ve done.  investors all of you you must have read or invested in some of them but i just want you to kind of have a look at it once and just let me know if it\\'s fine i\\'ll start yeah i\\'m okay okay uh just give me a thumbs up or just tell me it\\'s okay i\\'ll start yeah just just give me a minute just definitely  Yeah, good to go. Yeah. So I\\'ll start with Raju sir, your opinion first, since you know quite a few of these assets, I\\'m sure. I would understand like out of all these, like which ones are assets which you\\'re fine to have in your portfolio? No, I have all. You have all, but like what do you think are the good ones out of these? You have any opinion?  sort of investment it should be not more than five percent or definitely not more than ten out of your portfolio if you ask me i will not go beyond five or at the most maximum okay but like which one of these would you kind of are excited to have in your portfolio right uh tech mutual fund is better okay uh then uh fd in small uh finance banks it\\'s also playing good but then  put it correctly 5.2 is the range right now you get only 5.2 is the average range but one good thing is you can forget it no need to show in the tax returns and mostly these companies are government bonds either it is a pfc ntpc all those stuff so 100 secured no issue right the arbitrage fund is a okay you have to take call based on the actual fund okay and and if i give you a choice between a  percent, but I have heard that there is so much of expense ratio and this, so I don\\'t like, I won\\'t go for this. Right. So, but none of these are like your must have, like, at least I\\'ll have one of this in my portfolio. Like I do have sovereign gold bonds, but I would actually like an another product here, like corporate bonds. Like, okay. I know that it is not there, but okay. I don\\'t think so. These are, which amuses me.  haven\\'t seen a lot of them right and that\\'s probably what is uh creating an interest for me around those um yeah that\\'s that\\'s probably the two ones i would but just as products right not just as like you can get hdbs and debt mutual funds from different products but just as products like don\\'t they excite you don\\'t they don\\'t you feel that one of them should be in my portfolio definitely i would say that\\'s what i said right uh debt i am having right so i have  There\\'s a new product which kind of adds 7% capital appreciation on gold bonds. Is that something that you would like or you would say that I would get it from somewhere else? Or do you think it\\'s... Sorry, what\\'s the product going to look like? I didn\\'t get that quite right. So a product which kind of has a tool which gives you like a 7% appreciation on gold bonds. On gold bonds. So are you saying underlining asset is a gold  So if there is some, you know, there is a way to get an appreciation on that, yeah, probably, you know, should be a good product to look at. And when I compare it with, let\\'s say, a well-researched debt mutual fund, like what would be your thoughts on that? And when you say well-researched, right, what\\'s the value that I as an investor would get out of that? Probably a mutual fund which has a higher return and a lower expense ratio.  the product with gold. That\\'s probably where I\\'m kind of trying to get. And predominantly the reason being I do not see any product with that kind of a combination. As I said, the gold investment has just matured from how do I hold it. Nothing other than that has really happened onto that. If there\\'s something that\\'s happening with gold,  kind of correct price which kind of gives you a 7% capital appreciation on gold. For that actually you told us the alpha but you didn\\'t tell us that beta like what\\'s the risk? Right. The risk being the gold price itself right so. That\\'s it like why would someone give us the extra percent for that? Like I\\'m not really understanding. Is this helping you identify the right value of gold or right value of a gold bond?  understanding the fair value like let\\'s say what\\'s the what\\'s the face value of the bond versus what\\'s the actual price of gold in the market basis which you should purchase it at a price or not so a lot of times it happens that let\\'s say like what mr rad sir said that gold price when they are released or when the tranches are released was that the gold prices might fall which might actually reduce the value of the gold bond itself but the face value remains intact so the  Does that answer your question? Yes, it does.  supporting the investors in providing such a secondary market gold bonds and probably you\\'re taking us away on that actually it\\'s a good thought in the sense that when you\\'re able to get the say for example the series suppose assume i don\\'t remember the exact latter series i invested in fact every series i invest two grams five grams whatever it is so the thing is now also last 10 days back there was a series  when the gold rate is the same in the market how some of the series are able to give a better return and some are not able to give a better return in fact the issue price is going up every subsequent series so that is a catch there still i am not able to figure out what is the role behind that but given the statistics what we have on hand buying a gold bond at a  I will invest in this. Given an opportunity, I think this is a good investment opportunity. So yes, I do like this. Okay. Thank you. After knowing all the risks and after reading the whole papers. Right. Also now, I just wanted to close the discussion because you can have a good Saturday and a Sunday. Good weekend.  asset. So I am really immersed on that. So from a risk perspective, that helps me a lot. And also I\\'ve been looking into some of the assets, like they are coming in for the issue and they are sold in just a few hours. So I guess not just me, many people are focusing on Winfield and are really confident about it. So that really helps me a lot. And apart from Winfield,  That really is nice. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you for your kind words. Raj, sir, what values do you think we have? And one, we should always continue respectively where we are in the market. It\\'s innovation. Innovation is the very substance of growth and existence. So probably all these new companies which have come up, they are looking out of the box.  transparency and touch base with the investors, not only on the new products, but also on the products which are already marketed through. So that we have a feeling that Vintveld is with us. They are not only just doing marketing, but they also care for our investments. So that, for example, I don\\'t want to mean anything, but for example,  it is. As a company, for its own growth and survival, I think you have a better responsibility and commitment to take care of investors like us, so that we get more confidence and interest to increase our... Actually, now also I\\'m putting only 10k, 10k. Probably I can do much more than that. Probably I\\'m waiting for the one cycle to go and see how things are  data study which a company like Windwell does with its huge team so that what we cannot do as individuals are done by you and that gives a sense of confidence and interest in your products. Definitely, sir. Nitin, sir, your thoughts, where do you think is the critical value we should always have?  purely from a bond market for retail investors, there\\'s a good runway in terms of innovation. If you see even in your platform, there are quite a few bonds that are privately placed, which means we don\\'t have a way to trade. That could be a second set of innovations as well. Because as I said, if I am not able to have a good exit strategy, even though the value from a return of investment is good, the overall appeal may be a little less. And I think that\\'s probably where the next set  How can we at Vintveld improve your experience? Any suggestions for us to kind of help you improve your experience and interactions with Vintveld? Any improvement cues for us, sir? I think honestly dashboard, right? Dashboard for me can have some more information, right? In terms of everything. So today it is there, but it\\'s more of data put in, right? Not as an information for me,  So that\\'s one thing. Now, these are products that pay you at a recurring frequency, which means that the valuation now changes. When I started something with 10,000, probably after a year, the principal becomes 6,600 something. Now every calculation starts becoming on that. So for me, that is probably one thing which I would say from a platform perspective, that is where I want to see some kind of investments happening to help us really understand what\\'s happening with our portfolios. Sure.  where we can see like where we have put our money in and like so it could be better like it is good but I would say it is good but it could be better thank you I definitely get your point especially connect with you on the iOS aspect of it Rad sir your thoughts any improvement I really did not go too much into your dashboard and all the stuff because  Thank you.>transcript_3: < Thank you.  you  तो तेरे पास यह प्रेमियम यह प्रेमियम वाला है तो वही मैं अभी आप दोनों में इसे किसी एक को आइडमिन बनाकर निकल जाऊंगा तो  I think recording of the session is important.

Hello. Hi,  Yeah, I can see you. And I\\'m having it in mobile, so it would be shaky. No, no, that\\'s fine. You\\'re just having a conversation between friends or newly met people. So just think it from that lens.  wait for two, three more minutes. We are expecting one or two people more to come in. Once they come in, we will start. Sure.  Are we, Kapil, are we calling those folks?  Yes. Sunny, is it possible for you to put your camera on so we can have that clean discussion? Sure. Thanks, Sunny. So, first of all, I would like to thank all of you for your time and helping us. We really value your opinion at Win12th and I\\'m Kapil. And the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better,  in case I miss out on taking notes based on your opinion, I can always come back and come back and have a look at it. Is that fine? Yes, Kapil, I guess one more person is joining in a minute. Okay. So, in meanwhile, Amit has also joined in. So, I think, yeah, let\\'s start.  So Amit, thank you for your time. I was just explaining to everyone earlier that at Vintwell, we value your opinion and it helps us to serve your opinion and your understanding helps us to improve your experience with us. And this is just a call to understand you and there are no right or wrong answers on anything which we ask. You can kind of express your views openly  your release videos for any of the assets which are launched. So I go a lot by what you say. I hear you to the pin drop of every word what you mentioned. So it has a lot of impact on each and every of my investment decision. And I wanted to thank you because I see I invest a lot across a variety of alternate assets. You mentioned from crypto to NFT to your alt bonds to invoice discounting, peer-to-peer lending. But I guess whatever I hear from  Giraffe and certain other alt grip and other platforms. But I guess post this meet, hopefully that will change. Sure, sure, sure. Thank you. Thank you. I\\'ll reach out separately. Sure. Thanks, Amit. So just to, let\\'s just start, you know, I just want to kind of understand you. Let\\'s have an icebreaker here that can you just tell me about yourself, your name, your current job, what are your hobbies, what are your passions, one by one. So, you know, we kind of start with, you know, understanding each  left it midway, didn\\'t complete the third round because I was too much into my job. But I think from an investing perspective, heavily invested in stocks, real estate, all the old investments from the past year, year and a half. Yeah, so Amit, thanks for letting us know you\\'re investing, like you\\'re an avid investor as well. But just for this like icebreaker, let\\'s just understand,  for mutual funds, alternative investments, or all those. So not an avid reader from a book\\'s perspective, but LinkedIn posts, YouTube videos, some small articles, curated findings of certain folks whom I follow, certain people on Twitter, not that active on Twitter. But yeah, newspapers, economic times,  When Vintveld came on board, I was excited that the bond platform was being made open to the retail investors category. I don\\'t invest much of my capital, but a certain portion of it is being allocated to Vintveld. My passions, I do read quite a few books on fiction front and sometimes I follow the markets as well. So that\\'s how it is. Yeah. Thanks, Venkat. If you can,  research about investing platforms. So through, I mean, while doing that, I found out so that\\'s how I got associated with them. And I\\'m still learning a lot about investing through various YouTube videos and blogs. And I follow Achankya as well and LinkedIn. I\\'m getting a lot of useful information. Thanks, Achankya. And personally, I like to travel. So generally by two places.  caution and I\\'m put up in Faridabad. So yeah, primarily I\\'m in, I have been an avid investor. So currently I\\'m, let me just give a little background about myself. So I had around 10 years of experience in digital marketing and currently I\\'m working as a digital marketing consultant. So it was more kind of like an online journey for me because digital marketing is also created online. So then I started getting into more online investing.  real estate platforms also, which are like pools of your investments and all. So, but then I need to only invest in one platform. So then I choose Winfell because the kind of information I was checking on the website, the details of each assets, the research was done behind that each and everything. So then I started investing and all and whatever, whenever the new bond launched. So every second or third bond, I\\'ve tried to put even whatever I have, I mean,  So I\\'m very passionate about, I mean, researching about new investment opportunity and can be anything. I mean, not just restricted to, let\\'s say the stocks or, or like all these platforms and all, but can be any, whatever new investment I want to be updated. Let\\'s say whatever new investments are happening in the market, a particular retail investor can invest. So to how to maximize them also, that is all my passions, hobbies and everything. Yeah. So as I can see, everyone\\'s a very learned and,  investing. So can just can you just give me a gist of what kind of investment avenues you know and where do you kind of invest or where do you look to invest like everyone just flows for everyone. So generally as everyone do I do stock investing, bond investing as well as some mutual funds.  I primarily invest in the stocks through Zerodha platform and I also do the bond. My bond portfolio is through Windfield and a portion is through Bonds India as well. And as far as alternate investment goes, I invested through Grip in the leasing platform and also double some inventory financing. And apart from that, off the offset of the platforms, I also do personal a little bit of financing for certain companies.  but they host all the bonds. The thing about Vint is it curates the bond. And I think that specific focus on some of the assets which you\\'ll launch, that helps make a decision. No, no, I\\'m not coming to Vint yet. I just want to know you better. A lot more. Yeah. So I\\'m just giving you context. We\\'ll come to Vint later. Right now, I kind of want to understand how\\'s your investment behavior like.  And I realized that too much analysis leads to paralysis. So a lot of things were missed. But now I think the intention is good info coming from the right source. And that\\'s what helps me take my decisions a little bit faster. Okay. And Mohit, about you? So, yeah, I used to be active in stock markets and all.  yeah that\\'s how I\\'m currently I mean investing in all these platforms and all but yeah I mean I\\'m always open for looking out I mean I don\\'t invest in the time I\\'m had enough knowledge about that platform so let\\'s say I was currently might be studying grip invest I mean what they are offering each and everything and some other things and all here and there so yeah that is all so I just also want to know like like  So I personally want that at least in whatever situation, at least 50% of the income should be invested. I mean, that is apart from that, you can do whatever you want to spend here and there till the time you are able to save 50% monthly. But 50% is something that you need to be, I mean, something like, I personally, let\\'s say currently,  more kind of in a lump sum manner, whether if I\\'m doing a mutual fund investment, it\\'s more kind of like when the market goes a little bit down, I try to take advantage of that to a lump sum investment and all. And so, yeah, that is how currently I\\'m in my investment is. So, but yeah, I\\'ll try to in whatever month I make sure that to whenever, let\\'s say even windmill also, as I got a notification every time on my WhatsApp and all whenever windmill launches some new bonds. So I\\'ll make sure that whatever, if it\\'s,  And I think some of the lower rated bonds, even on wind, would fall part of that. So otherwise, from a crypto NFT, another perspective that is approximately even leasing finance, asset financing and all those things will be around 70% of that. So around 30-40 in large caps, 20 in mid caps, around 20, somewhat 20 in BBB plus or minus bonds.  the remaining 20% would go towards roughly between gold and other steady assets. I think I will go next. So I roughly save 40-50% of my salary. But most of my investment will be ad hoc because I haven\\'t found any platform where I get consistent opportunities like this.  in some products. Like let\\'s say I open my app every day or when kinds of give me a notification, things like that. So there are some regular investing products. So I want to understand that like what do you look in when you invest regularly in such products? Like what are your needs? What do you look for? Then you kind of, okay, consider I\\'ll invest in such products. Like what are your thoughts on such behavioral and products?  like you as investors like what are the things you look for when you invest in a product i think returns right is what we ultimately look for so it is uh depends on uh you know equity doesn\\'t have a standard uh rate of return right so when we are investing in equity we in our minds there is at the back of our mind let\\'s say and if you\\'re a long-term investor you\\'re looking at  capital return. When you invest in SIP, what are the things you look for? Ours is to everyone. I guess everyone does invest in SIP. SIP is directed towards ETFs only. I don\\'t invest in particular individual large cap stocks because even picking the individual large cap stocks becomes a bit of a hassle. Over the long term, I feel that  allocation or selection of assets being one like what else do you look into it I think credibility of the product so we have to understand the product and have faith on it and there should be some kind of regulations so which will give us some hope because we are going to consistently invest on the product so we could have safety and return so if all these parameters are good so we are convinced to actually invest regularly in the product okay and uh Ahmed  My expectations are very realistic. But one thing I always take care of is that my principal should be safe. Whatever investment I\\'m doing, whatever risk I\\'m taking, I\\'ll take in that manner that I\\'ll make sure in worst-case scenario, if let\\'s say after two years I\\'m not able to make money for whatever reason, my principal should be negative or something in whatever stock I\\'m investing or whatever kind of. That is the core issue.  for stocks and I think for cryptos it\\'s more or less how the market is behaving. For bonds it\\'s primarily the ratings. I know they don\\'t count and the commentary which I get and basically established names. So even though the names might be established if the rating is poor then I think it\\'s primarily ratings for bonds and  Just for everyone\\'s like just to understand things better like I would ask this to everyone. So if pedigree is not there, you wouldn\\'t invest in it. It is the most critical aspect for you. That is the touching point like pedigree is critical. If pedigree is not there, I\\'ll not invest. Is that something which you look to? So it definitely adds a lot of weightage, but it\\'s not that  that if pedigree contributes 40%, rating contributes 30%, technical levels contribute 20%, 10-20% sentiments, it\\'s like the score should be above 60-65+. That can take a rough sentiment. That\\'s how I usually do it. Okay. So if a sentiment is, let\\'s say, less than 60, you will never invest in such a product or anything like that.  I, whatever investment is there, I think I\\'ll particularly look out for, let\\'s say fundamentals and all. I mean, because I\\'m not a investor for, let\\'s say if I\\'m investing something, so I\\'ll do a short time investing for 15 days, one month, two months. If I\\'m investing, it\\'s definitely a longer period of let\\'s say minimum of one year. So for me, fundamental of let\\'s say, whatever it\\'s a bond, let\\'s say it\\'s a bond, whether it\\'s a senior security,  the bond of some company and all. So I\\'ll definitely want to go ahead and check out their website once. Whatever bonds I\\'m invested on, I have checked all of their websites. So how strong they are fundamentally and what kind of, because all I into, let\\'s say, disbursing credits to people or to B2B credits and all. So just for me, fundamental of whatever investment is there, it\\'s very important. Sarath, Venkat, your thoughts? Like what is that critical thing for you? I think I agree with Mohit.  currency, then I will actually leave behind with that product. I don\\'t choose that. Okay. Okay. And you know, any favorite investment and you connect on a emotional level with it, let\\'s say, you know, I connect with bonds on an emotional level because of that security they offer me like any product which you can emote to an emotional level or your favorite product which you invest in?  So I am meeting you for the first time and these are your friends considering you\\'ve interacted with them in the past. So can you just help me introduce them? Like I want everyone to introduce an equity to me. Let\\'s start with how would you introduce equity to me? He\\'s your friend, right? You invest in stocks, you understand what equity is. Imagine that equity stock is your person next to you. He\\'s your friend. So how would you introduce to me?  I would say that I suppose. As far as bonds go, I think he is my most trusted friend and I am sure that he would not give up on me at any point of time. FD is also I would say the same thing. As far as gold goes, gold is a little unpredictable for me. He is there but I am not sure what he will give me later on. That would be an apt justification. Equity and FD and  Traditional thought, but yeah. And what, like just personify them, like what would FD be wearing and what would Bonds be wearing as clothes? FD is, you know, plain clothes, nothing fancy. Nothing fancy. Plain, maybe white and black shirts or something like that. Bonds a little bit fancier instead of white, let\\'s say, a lot of pink color or green color. But again, plain. Formal. Yeah. Equities would be dancing their heart out.  interesting everyone\\'s going to interact more on that. Sarath, what you mentioned, I agree with it. But equity do carry the potential of that volatile friend that you need to keep on paying attention to that friend. The moment you ignore him, he can come and bite you in the ass. So I think you constantly got to keep a close watch and keep on giving that leverage and keep on as an extending  completely but I think it\\'s worth taking that bet so I look at it from that perspective so these are friendships like which might work out and which might not work out that\\'s how I look at it okay Mohit you have any different thoughts or let\\'s say you want to assign any actor or cricketer to these four people like who would you assign and why so yeah I think my thoughts are also related to what others said so it\\'s like similar to what equity is definitely for me  If you have invested two years before or like all that. So yeah, I think an FD is something that\\'s like till the time you\\'re investing FD through your parents who are senior citizens, it\\'s good to go. Because through senior citizens, you\\'ll get additional interest 0.5 or 1% extra. Yeah, I\\'m not asking him as an interest, how much interest he\\'s getting. I\\'m asking how is he as a friend? Or like if you would say FD as an actor, would you play FD in a movie?  Rahul and also these can be a bond. I mean, I can say because these are newcomers and in the market, I mean, bonds are there, but now the popularity that these are getting. You mean KL Rahul or Rahul Javed? No, KL Rahul. So, yeah. So now these, how these are being, I mean, bonds are there since ages, but now how these are people are getting to know bonds and they are through different platforms are coming through which you can invest in bond like WinFend and all.  to use with that platform okay so we can i mean we have some some kind of trust so as as he said rahul sachin could be good examples for fda and gold and bond and stocks are what to say so stocks i can say shave up okay bonds i would say some other reliable player i i can\\'t find any app player for that actually  Not yet. Not yet. Is it visible now? Yes. People who have joined from mobile, can they see it? Can they read it actually? Can you read it? Yeah. So, yeah.  Basically, a fixed income platform is a platform which will, you know, avail access to fixed income securities and manage your fixed income portfolio in one single place. So things like gold bonds backed by RBI, listed bonds by NFCs and other businesses, fixed deposits, debt mutual funds, you know, arbitrage funds for emergencies. And what you will be able to do on the platform is on the platform, you will be able to buy and sell securities, you know, avail credit  All the different kind of securities which will be available like debt mutual fund itself as a security, gold bonds, listed bonds. So you can sell and buy those on this platform. Okay.  you don\\'t actually do anything to hedge risk directly on equity basically you direct seven so if equity falls like your debt investment bond investment uh or at least uh like their to support really so yeah so does anyone have any further questions so we are good to go  I would want your opinion around this on various aspects. So this is just something which might come up by any company or if this comes into the market as a proposition. So I would want your opinion on that. So if you can, if everything\\'s good to go, I\\'ll ask questions around it. Okay.  it will be useful and I might try it out but can\\'t say for certain though. Yeah, Venkat, Mohit, Amit, your thoughts? I would also agree with that because right now it is all scattered across different platforms so for us also it is a bit difficult for us to manage each and every platform. So if everything is available in one platform definitely so I will also try it out. Mohit, Amit?  same time you have investment on ETS or like different kind of platforms and all. So definitely these will be available in the one platform. Definitely it\\'s going to be a good idea for customer perspective. Okay. And Amit, your thoughts? See, as per me and I\\'m specifically talking from a Vint platform perspective, I think, see Vint, I look at it as a boutique platform catering to a particular need.  Or you are comfortable with having boutique stuff or boutique investments? Is that your thought? And you would say this doesn\\'t kind of fulfill my need. I think unless there is something unique in this, I think these things are available. Maybe fragmented, but they are easily available, easily accessible. People will go to the least costliest platform and crowd over there.  there\\'s any expectation you think that should be from a platform so you expect it to bring products which are unique in nature is that what i\\'m saying right when i say unique it should be value adding it should cut down some of the okay so it should value add yeah in can you help me understand that where can it value add so like uh there are tons of debt mutual funds right  to do this okay and uh mohit venkat sarath what are your expectations from such platform like what do you think is expected from these plat like this platform what are your expectations from it so according to me it could be a simplicity so i could reach out one platform instead of managing multiple platforms so as i use the perspective that\\'s what i can  supposing I want to tap more into it, there should be some option where I\\'m able to liquidate it through the platform. So that is the issue with the fixed income platforms right now, right? They don\\'t offer liquidity. Even if you\\'re offering a six-month or three-month liquidity, it is not complete liquidity. I should be able to immediately liquidate it like that, but that is what is lacking on the fixed income platforms. If that is there in this platform, I think I would even push more and happily invest more.  ratio, what is this ratio, what is the market cap and all these kinds of things. So those can be, let\\'s say, how, let\\'s say, I\\'ll take an example of WinFed. So I don\\'t understand the bond market, but how the information was available there. So it was pretty much easy. Even a layman person who is not much into bonds at any time, he can go through it and each, everything is visible very clearly. So similarly, I\\'ll expect the same thing for other platforms also, whether it\\'s a debt mutual funds, even a layman language can understand that without,  when you look at such a platform like this should be there without this you know everything\\'s a bit dicey like the most critical factor you feel I think critical factor it\\'s mean just to show the transparency like if you\\'re investing in this product whether it depth or what are the chances of I mean risk and all involves it should be very transparent and all should be very clear I mean  And when would you visit such a platform? Let\\'s say there\\'s any product service you would want or any moment like, okay, today\\'s a bonus day I got or like, when would you visit this platform? I would be regular. There\\'s no specific, you know, day or month or day event which would trigger my investment. I think that would be regular. I\\'ll be regularly maybe on a monthly basis. No mood to kind of like today, I\\'m happy.  Okay. Okay. And Mohit Ahmed? So you are asking when will we visit a website or a platform like this? Yeah, yeah, yeah. When like, I would visit a platform and I\\'m happy or I\\'ve gotten, my office went well, so I would want to make an investment or some amount got credited, I would want to kind of  There are a couple of other facts. Apart from debt funds, arbitrage and FDs, the first two you all are already doing to a certain extent. I think you all had some gold bonds, maybe not backed by RBI. I didn\\'t see SGD on their platform, but I think I saw some other bonds which are backed by gold earlier, but not the SGD ones. Some differentiations are there  exploring around platform. Is that your thoughts when I look at this platform versus Vint? So, see, it will depend on how you execute it. Like, these things are there outside. Unless you have curated or add value to it, then it can be of the same caliber of Vint currently. But if you are bringing the entire plethora of debt funds, arbitral funds, FDs, then there is no differentiator, right?  about Vint like everyone about this? I think the portfolio for Vint should increase more. I think it is comparatively less. I know you\\'re picking out the best ones but again I think your larger portfolio and availability on a continuous basis would be better. For example, the product you\\'re marketing right now gets sold out quickly.  your perspective instead of you know as I say waiting for my redemption to come through a liquidity option would be better is what I am feeling because ones which are market are not listed so I am not I may not be able to sell that on the market as well so that liquidity option is taken away from me so if that is provided it would be better okay so Venkat and Amit you have any different thoughts on it so from my perspective what I would say is  other one is like all the products they are having the minimum ticket set of 10,000. So even though it is applicable for every investor, sometimes the investors can have 5 lakhs or 50,000 or something. So even if there are portfolios which can offer with minimum ticket set of 50,000 or 1 lakh or something. So other part of some advanced investors can also instead of just looking for because if they invest in  I think the true metal will be tested when, hopefully not, but if any one of the assets listed default in some form or manner, that is when the risk measures and all those things will come into play. I think, hopefully not. Sooner or later, that might happen. And the longer you all will avoid it, the longer, the more name. So I think that what do you call risk mitigation process in selection has to be more rigorous.  metal will be tested once we hit a roadblock in any of these assets and how you all actually get that recovery done and how much is lost in that process that will be the true test so I think risk avoidance will be the crucial metal which I rely on wind at least that due diligence process never lacks in any form or manner right but any other experience aspect like you want us to improve so you have a better kind of  let it come through. UPI, let it come through. Don\\'t restrict it. I have to put it in a wallet, which is Vint wallet. And those kinds of things are, I think, not a smooth process for anyone. And apart from that, what the others mentioned that sometimes the asset gets sold out and other things. And I think there has to be some categorization. So if I\\'m investing, if I want to invest five lakhs plus, there should be some advantage, which I should get from Vint. There has to be some differentiation in the clientele. So if I have 20 lakhs invested,  I think that that should definitely continue. Is this transparency or is this something like from this is something which is like what how would you say that value? The amount of information which you all give over a YouTube seminar for a new asset release is not there on your website. So had I read only through what I what is listed on your website and not listen to one of those forums where Ajinkya and some of the other teams from Vint and even the from the  listening to it, I would easily point out the difference. So I think somewhere that has to come back on your website. Okay, so you like our expertise or our transparency if I can ask you to make that judgmental call. Definitely a fan of both. There is no complaints about that. I\\'m saying we should retain that edge is my request. That\\'s what I\\'m saying. Right, that\\'s and Sarath and Venkat, like what one value you think we should always have irrespective of what  I think, yeah, I think bonds were, you know, I was skeptical on selecting the bonds because bonds are not transparent. So the transparency which you brought in, you know, paved the way for me investing in the bonds perspective. So I think you solved that problem for me. Okay. And Venkat, this is my last question. I\\'ll be kind of signing off in case you guys want to kind of add anything to help us. Yeah. So bond investing, actually,  what about you like how did we help you out as well I think same I think curating the bonds in what you all bring in I think that\\'s been a big help those seminars were a big help the candidness with Ajankya team and everyone is there that helps the platform is simple that helps I don\\'t know I think you all make money on the arbitrage  for delaying and thanks a lot for your time and helping us understand you better and we hope that you get a better wind experience everyone. Ajinkya, any parting thoughts? No, no, no, thank you. Though I was observing, I was just listening and taking some notes and like just ruminating some thoughts like about RMT but very insightful discussion. At least I have a lot of things to think about. So thank you for your time and honest thoughts. Thank you.>transcript_4: < you  If possible, can you turn on your camera just for a conversation? We\\'re just waiting for one more person from my team to join and two more people to join the call and then we\\'ll start. Hi. Hi. Hi. Anush, Ayush, am I audible? Yeah, you\\'re audible. Great. Welcome.  Hello. A couple. Can you hear me? You\\'re audible. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, hi. Hi everyone. I\\'m really sorry for joining a few minutes late. I really apologize for that considering you have given us  Thanks a lot, Ayush. Anush, Shankar, Kanjan, is that something which is possible for you? Oh, great. Yeah, I\\'ll just turn it on initially, but I\\'m going to turn it off in a bit. Sure, sure. I completely understand that. So first of all, I would like to thank you for joining us and your opinion is very valuable towards that. I\\'m Kapil and the purpose of this discussion is to understand your needs better  that this will not go in any wrong hands. And thank you for giving your time on a short notice on a working day. I will just start myself let\\'s by understanding everyone. So let\\'s start by like this is an icebreaker. I\\'m Kapil and my hobbies are like watching football, playing FIFA, looking at various sports. So these are my hobbies and reading out books,  All these types of investments and all I am looking from very earlier this type of platform. But now I get this platform in wealth. Okay. And any new movies you have watched? Sorry? Any new movies you have seen? Just now I have seen two days before that Katputli. Mainly I watched that Aichai Kumar\\'s film. Okay. Okay. Nice. It\\'s a nice film to watch. Okay.  I find it interesting. So being with my job, so I was working in HR before. So past one year doing some freelance stuff for some projects based on Ethereum and Solana. So that\\'s about it. So I was using Win12 because it seemed unique. So there was nothing between bonds and then stocks. And then Win12 was one of the first products to get those products. Sorry to interrupt, Varun. I\\'ll come back on Win12 later. I want to kind of know you first.  Right now I am in Vakala so I have come to a friend\\'s wedding. Okay, nice. Anush, if you can just introduce yourself and I get to know you better. Yeah, I am a techie and like Varun said I am interested in personal finance. So my hobbies include travelling and playing sport.  Yeah, so this is Kanjan. I am a software developer. So hobbies are like mostly nothing. Right now my weekends are mostly around like playing badminton and meditation, reading books or watching movies. The last movie that I watched was like Karthikeya 2. Okay. Yeah, I pretty much work in, I worked in FinTech as well. So on Forex,  I am into software development. I have been in, I think, industry for 15 years now. And I was also part of some of the startups earlier, which were into a core software development. Besides that, I\\'m also a stock market enthusiast. And I also like to evaluate fixed income products.  and movie enthusiasts on the panel. So I think hopefully we can have a good discussion. I\\'ll just start with you, Omkar. What kind of investment products do you invest in? With the various investment products available, where do you invest in? Without going into specifics, I have investments in US and Indian markets primarily.  diversifying with various geographies. But like in fixed income, what products you invest in or like you\\'re aware of but you don\\'t invest in those products? So earlier, like when I was like graduating from college or like early in my career, I used to buy those long-term RAC, PFC bonds. That was my favorite thing earlier. They had lock-in period but they were giving decent returns.  any products with like 10% of taxation, right? So I think that has like, to be very frank, like dampened a bit of my journey towards Vint wealth. So I actually invested heavily earlier. But recently, due to these issues, I have like, kind of ramping down my investments in Vint wealth and actually and as an alternative, like investing more into some of the mutual funds, like debt schemes, so that I can also pledge those investments and  So, yeah, for me, like it\\'s a mix of bags again, like some of the SIPs in mutual funds across like, as Omkar has mentioned, some in US market, some in Indian market, some is in like debt fund, some in mid cap and something like that, like majorly equity based. For fixed income or bond, something I\\'ve been like using Vintwell. In fact, like I was among the first 100 investor in Vintwell.  or like Anush, how do you do that? Like I pay my bills and then I see what amount I\\'ve left and then I invest. Anush, your thoughts? Sure, sure. Yeah, so I\\'m just going to echo what the other two people said. So I have a decent corpus split between debt, equity and gold. I follow the Zazat allocation based on the age and my target. So equity is predominantly in mutual funds and I also have a PMS.  the strict asset allocation. So once a quarter, I review it and then the incremental investments go based on what the asset allocation is. Sorry, go ahead. No, no, no. Sorry to interrupt, Anush. Yeah, and just the last part was whenever I have leftover money, whether it is a bonus or salary or anything of that sort. So I\\'ve got this recurring SIPs going, so that continues.  market because that turns out to be a discounted one okay and and one more thing uh which i would want to ask that you said you kind of look at investment goals so like is this goals based on returns is it goal based on life goals like i invest that okay after five years i want to buy a car so i would invest in such a way or my father does that key after five years i\\'m on this much corpus so he\\'ll invest in that way so like what is your  or like how do you kind of where do you invest in what do you do when you invest in hello yeah hello yeah i\\'m audible yeah yeah yeah yeah hi i actually prefer to invest in different uh like diversify the my investments i invested in the first in fd also for liquidity uh because yes i  uh any particular thought in mind uh no just i am making my investment in all portfolios every month there is no like goal or something but i\\'ve been uh preferred vince wealth and ppf more because i want to take less risk okay uh so ppf and business consider this the best option for investment okay uh ppr is now a little less than like around seven to eight percent interest is given  Hello, Varun, you\\'re not audible. Hello. Yeah, you\\'re audible right now. Hello, I\\'m audible. Am I audible now? Yeah, you\\'re completely audible. Yeah. Sorry. So Kapil, I was saying in terms of traditional investments, it\\'s mostly passive for me now. So mostly invest in index funds and then for debt exposure, invest in Vintveld. I use it as one of the platforms and then  index funds and then a little bit of debt and then actively manage the portfolio. So that is what I\\'ve been up to till now. Okay. Okay. And you have any life goals when you look for, when you invest, like, or do you kind of, no, no, nothing, nothing. Yeah. Fortunately, unfortunately I\\'m no one is dependent on me right now. So I\\'m a lot of flexibility. Okay. I, okay. I get it. So,  ease of exit is something especially in crypto markets because there are a lot of smart contractors that are involved so i want to be able to access my funds as mostly stay away from any products that require lockup say most of those products need a one month or one year lockup to get a risky yield so mostly stay away from those and then mostly focus on uh data neutral strategies okay the funds that i manage actively trying to hedge all the positions and then  look into uh instruments or products when you invest and what are the other things you look at when you invest and not just the critical aspects uh yeah so critical aspect is like i look after like uh the expected returns and the time frame these two things are for me like according to the time frame if i\\'m getting the proper return those two things are quite critical like a prima facie parameter and other things are like uh if it is like how  then yeah i will not worry much about like risk or time uh i will invest in that somehow like whatever amount i can according to my goals uh yeah okay and anush like what are you sorry uh what do you look at uh when you kind of look at various products yeah so the primary thing is asset allocation right and within the asset say for example equity split between  is for you when I actually have a multiple asset allocation? Like how cumbersome is for you to look at various platforms when you do investments or do you have one place where you get everything or like you want to look at specialists? How do you look at asset allocation? Yeah, so it\\'s a little, yeah, it\\'s not straightforward like you rightly said. So there are a couple of platforms that I have to go get the data and plug it into an Excel sheet that I have.  what is the security and all things and how much it is subscribed and subscription basis I will apply on that and mainly I want that windmill should increase the return on the period also mainly only for two or three years the bonds has been issued in the windmill till now right yeah so maybe for four or five years it should increase the period and interest rate also right  For liquidity basis, I maintain another fund in FD and Mitchell funds and all. So I\\'m not looking for liquidity. So I want for long-term investments. Okay. Can you primarily look at safety and security? Yeah. Then you look at returns. Yeah, of course. Anush, sorry, I kind of forgot. I\\'m recollecting. You said you have an Excel sheet to kind of look at all your investments.  not within the boundary then it it will just say how much i need to allocate that\\'s all okay okay and and uh quite interesting and uncle like uh what do you look at at the various investment products uh yeah you have in mind and like what are your perceptions on those products and what is very critical for you when you look to invest somewhere yeah so for me uh i just don\\'t look at returns and safety but i always evaluate the product from the taxation  in some of the instruments and not just like equity but also debt. Okay. Okay. And just a question to everyone, right? Have you invested in small cases? I did and I am actually exiting from it right now because I found the impact cost huge actually. Okay. The way the small case managers have productized or even small case,  Ayush, Varun, have you invested in small case? Yeah, I did a little bit, but I just agree with whatever was said earlier. A lot of overhead costs. So unless our investments are really high, so my philosophy is that I\\'m okay to pay money. So the expense ratio I try to have is 1%.  primarily or an SGB, how would you think of them as personalities, as people, as movie characters? Everyone\\'s a movie buff here. So like what movie character or an actor would an SGB be? What would be a bond be? And what would be an equity be? Anyone wants to kind of take it first or you guys want to have a think through like, yeah,  companies it\\'s about how how equity is like akshay kumar like like yeah so full of action yeah so one person said equity is like ranveer singh right he\\'s very weird out of the box wears different clothes it goes up and down here and there is energetic so you\\'ve said akshay kumar which was very interesting so i want to know what is he if let\\'s say akshay kumar and equity is the same person let\\'s he\\'s making a biopic on equity how would he be acting on  Okay.  So the thing is with Nassil Sinta, I thought Nassil Sinta is always underrated and then it\\'s always quality. But then in the mainstream, not a lot of people enjoy, but there is always back and forth in all of his movies. So Bond is also something similar. So since the last decade has been up only in the market, people forget that you need to have some Bond exposure. That\\'s where I think I thought of Nassil Sinta.  or like in any character that he plays, right? And you kind of believe when he talks. What he talks, you believe, right? So that is one key takeaway for Bond. Like they give you the return promised assuming all the other conditions are somewhat reasonable and like everything else is okay. So I found that to have like pretty much similar characteristics. Okay. And  is right. And still there are a lot of people who have not yet explored his acting, which is analogous to Windwell trying to expand its horizons. And Kanjan, your thought? I can\\'t really take any name, but someone like newcomer and doesn\\'t have any back support in the industry, but still is doing well.  movies that much but I kind of no no I was just saying that no someone who\\'s not noticed for long but started to make the presence felt right I think I would I would go with someone like that so if Windwell was in your friend circle right if he was your friend in your group like how would he be as that person in the group  I think Will Will is also like this and providing the return like Raskima Rao only in the films. Right. Right. So steady returns. Varun, you want to add something to this? Any actor would you want or any cricketer you want maybe? Hello, Varun? Varun, you\\'re not audible.  is very sharp but then needs some advertising from others or maybe doesn\\'t want to advertise that much in the group. Okay. Okay. So he\\'s not a very extrovert person. He\\'s more like stays amongst himself, gives you the advice. Okay. He\\'s always the go-to person within the group because everyone within the group knows that that person is the sharpest one.  gauge your, you know, your perceptions and thought around those products. So just let me know if my screen\\'s visible. It\\'s not visible yet. Okay. So, Sidant, is it visible now? Yeah. So,  or any additional information you might need. So just this, you might know these assets already, or you might be investing in those assets currently, or might have done in the past. But I just want you to kind of just go through it once. And I\\'ll get everyone\\'s thought on these assets. Once I get a confirmation from everyone that we\\'re good to go. Can either give me a thumbs up can can unmute ourselves and go like I\\'m fine with it.  And Omkar, are we good to go? Okay, Omkar is good to go. So I think everyone\\'s good to go. Or does anyone want to kind of take like two, three minutes more and read through it once more? Yeah, I think everyone\\'s good to go. So I\\'ll start with Kanjan. So like you\\'ve seen these assets. Can you just help me with some of the assets which you would want to be in your portfolio? Like, okay, these are two, three good assets.  If you kind of have to choose between a debt or an FD aggregation as the must have for you, then what would you choose? I think FD aggregation. Okay, FD aggregation. Very interesting. Varun, your thoughts? Hello.  mid-term liquidity and then arbitrage funds is where there will be consistent yield which is in a way not dependent on market direction so a sort of a hedge in terms of returns are always consistent over a long enough time horizon. That is the reason I will go with arbitrage fund. And if you kind of had to choose one to be more primary or like if you had to kind of choose between both of them like what would you choose?  that can be only captured by institutions with a particular type of infrastructure that I don\\'t have exposure to. That is something that excites me. Okay. I cannot do it on my own. And then. Okay. And, and Anush, your thoughts. Sorry, what was the question? Is it, we have to choose one of this or. Just give me like two, three out of which you would want in your portfolio. And then we\\'ll come to the one.  I\\'d probably go with the debt mutual fund simply because you would not redeem them for the next five, six years. So hopefully get the tax benefit and also get the rate cycle going. So that would be my choice. And if apart from a debt mutual fund, you had to choose a couple of products, which ones would you like? I would go for the sovereign gold,  it looks to be going up maybe in the next six months and then it might come down further. So probably take advantage of that. And from the taxation standpoint, you know, LTCG will kick in after 36 months. So that\\'s the hope. Okay. And Omkar, what are your thoughts? Like, what do you look for and what would your choice be? So I would primarily go for debt mutual fund here because,  I just share my screen again. Ayush, did I ask you the question? No. I\\'m really sorry. I missed you out. Yeah, no worry. So which one would you choose as your primary? Out of this, I think I will go for Debt Mutual Fund and Apti. Mainly the Debt Mutual Fund is for because of low risk and high return. And for Apti,  for this network. Okay. And I\\'ll just share my screen once again to show you a proposition. Let\\'s say a company comes out with such a platform, a website or an app. I would want to kind of understand your thoughts and your perceptions around that. Just let me know if my screen is visible. Yeah, it\\'s visible. So let\\'s say a company comes out as a fixed income platform, which is a website or an app, which will give access to fixed income security.  Yeah, I think it\\'s a good option, good choice to bring all this in single platform. But any apprehensions around that? Sorry? Any things which makes you like worrisome like if all these come on one platform or do you think it just makes your life easier? In this, I think everything is included in this.  mislead with the information and that rate of return, the actual rate of return should show in the screen. It\\'s not like top or something like that. It does not mislead the investor that you will get this if you\\'ve done this or all this thing. Okay. So a truthful and honesty approach is something. Yeah. And it should be on time. If you\\'re saying the interest will be given on this day, then it should be deposited that day only.  It would be not something that is present today, right? So people would have to park their money, which cannot be used for anything else. So like I mentioned, my other use cases are, I also want to have margin for my investments, right? And I also want to have that taxation advantage where if I have to go and buy and sell on the platform,  portfolio, then sure. But if a use case is to have like, like a cherry on top and use it for multiple use cases, then I would not be interested in that. Okay. But any, any way, let\\'s say if you kind of onboard on that competition platform or that other platform, like any expectations you want that, okay, even if you\\'re coming with this, this is something I would want on that platform. Yeah. One would be like, like ease of like, like doing day-to-day activities, right? Like,  So basically understanding the customer and its need would be like, I think paramount for any platform. Okay. So I would focus on that basically. But you are such a savvy investor yourself. So do you think it would impact you? If I did not have those other use cases, then I would want to have parked some money at least, right? Because that would help me evaluate. And of course, I think returns, we did not talk about returns, right?  mind having some allocation if i don\\'t have uh the other two use cases that i described okay and and kanjan your thoughts on this like such a platform coming on board do you think it makes your like easy difficult untrustworthy or some expectations you want from this platform so is it like will it allow me to like uh do the transactions as well or just like portfolio  it makes my life easier. Also in terms of making transactions, if I\\'m having the data, like earlier what happens in mutual fund, I had to register with each AM and later then these platforms came and they provided everything at one place. So it would be good for me, but only thing that I\\'ll be worried is my security and my privacy. Now since everything I can do from one place, so let\\'s say my security has been compromised,  to be very clean uh i need easy interface like any expectations from that platform yeah so basically like two expectation in terms of usability one is a proper tracking and proper in terms of dashboard like proper tracking of what is how like how each section is doing and how much i have contributed generally what percent of my total is there and that particular section how much it has gained  kind of planning like what we say plantation of what my funds will actually look, how tax will actually look. Okay. And Anush, your thoughts? You want to add something to it? You want to have a... Yeah. So this is very attractive, right? If this is one platform that I can use for my debt portfolio, that would be great. So maybe RBI bonds have to come in, right?  Because debt is a lot of importance given to taxation, STCG, LTCG. Now, if there is a dashboard that can tell you about realized or unrealized gains, that would really help. Okay. And anyone else wants to add to what would their expectations be? Or everyone\\'s fine with the sort of expectations? Varun, Ayush? Yeah, just now that he said like he should give the  an ios app but we are definitely working on this and we\\'ll do it soon yeah because i\\'m very much eagerly waiting for that right right so uh now you\\'ve said that what are your problems with vint well uh if anyone wants to uh kind of you know and have any concerns any experience improvement uh areas for us we definitely would want to help there and improve ourselves as vint  both users and then the ones who want to get into the product even though it is so a marketplace where you can buy and trade yeah right right definitely we\\'ll have to look at regulations and everything but definitely get your suggestion I think it\\'s a very valuable insight for us Anuj, Kanjan, Omkar any things which you want us to improve I think I have just  there is a principle, there is interest and there\\'s tedious on the interest, right? So if that detail shows up, then that\\'ll be great. Okay, definitely. I think you can view that in the dashboard, but I think due to regulatory reasons, we can\\'t split payments when we credit to your bank account. Siddhant, if my understanding is right on this? Yeah, but it\\'s partly incomplete, but like it is something that\\'s being worked upon. So that\\'s,  can there be a MLD product with like a 10% taxation for the long term? I would jump on it right away. If there is any clarity on that aspect, that would be great. Just like a note maybe that it\\'s not possible or it\\'s not in the pipeline or something like that, that would also be okay. I was just saying that what we can do is we can get back to you with something regarding this specifically because it\\'s a pretty specific  my parting last question is that one thing you you like about Vint and you want that whatever we do in life later as an organization you want that value that we should always retain as Vint 12th like one value Omkar if you want to add yeah not one actually there are many right what I like about Vint 12th is transparency right you\\'re absolutely transparent I have like a lot of I do a lot of your  like there is like disclaimer everywhere that do not get on board uh if you don\\'t understand the risks right or don\\'t blindly put in all your money you just have to allocate five to ten percent of your portfolio so i think there are no other products uh available or like there are no other other owners who give this kind of disclaimers or like uh educate people so i think uh i think that was primarily the reason why i uh i went ahead and actually invested a lot of things  There\\'s some other value we should always have or something we should always return. Yeah, I agree with Omkar. It\\'s transparency and it\\'s display and everything. Disclaimer, it\\'s good. I didn\\'t find like this in any other platform. Thank you, thank you, Ankur. Thank you, Omkar. I think you summarized it so beautifully that everyone\\'s agreeing to it. Yeah, I think Kanjan has given a round of applause to you for that. So thanks, Omkar.>about_company: <Opportunities are what helps humanity unlock true potential, but it gets challenging if it\\'s only accessible to a few. We believe everyone should have access to opportunities that are only available to some. So we took a first step towards building a process that makes unique assets accessible to everyone for investment with a remarkably lower ticket size. Some said we were crazy to think everyone will understand these advanced assets. So, we centred our aim towards education and transparency. You\\'ll be surprised to see that the risks are mentioned alongside the fixed returns because we don\\'t sell. We feel we are doing something meaningful and right because here you are. At Wint Wealth, we make sure that you know about the assets as much as we do because you are the one who knows what\\'s better for you. Zerodha-backed startup Wint Wealth is offering covered bonds structure for retail investors, offering 9-11% returns at ticket sizes starting from as low as Rs 10,000. Wint Wealth is an alternative investment platform democratising debt investment options for retail investors. In an interaction with FE Online, Wint Wealth co-founder Ajinkya Kulkarni said, “For retail investors investment options have either been low-risk low-return Fixed Deposits or high-risk high-return equity exposure, moderate-risk moderate-return were always out of reach because of high ticket sizes, Wint Wealth is changing that by democratizing one asset structure at a time.”\\n\\nCurrently, the company is focussing on educating more investors about what Wint Wealth is doing, who can invest in what it offers, and why they should consider investing.\\n\\n“At Wint, we are on a mission to unlock debt investment opportunities for retail investors considering portfolio diversification. Our services are catered towards enabling individual investors enter the debt landscape, previously exclusive only to HNIs and UHNIs, with a ticket size as low as Rs. 10,000. While industry share of alternative assets is $10 Trillion, India accounts for $19 Billion of alternative asset/debt investment share. The potential to invest in alternative assets is huge and the platform is expected to reach Rs 500 Crore AUM by end of the year and Rs 10,000 crores worth of assets by 2024. We hope to make debt investing easy and accessible to Indian investors (retail. HNIs) across the breadth of the country,” said Ajinkya.\\n\\nAlso Read 7th Pay Commission: DA hike announced in early March, but why some employees and pensioners await revised pay and arrears?

Follow these tips to enhance your loan eligibility\\n\\nIs Wint Wealth different from competitors?\\n\\nAjinkya said Wint’s aim is to be an investor-centric and transparent company in the alternate investment space. “We advise and educate investors to diversify their portfolio and not just limit themselves to investing with us rather have a well balanced portfolio. We want people to understand the risk-return profile of the investment and put 10-15% of their overall portfolio eventually in Wint Wealth assets,” he said.\\n\\n“We have taken a route of one guided by regulations, assets we provide are listed on the exchange and thus, rated by the rating agencies with the end units actually transferred to the investors Demat account providing the much-needed transparency for investors who are putting their hard-earned money in the structures we provide,” Azinkya added.\\n\\nTraditionally, Debt Investments was initially only available to the Ultra HNIs as the ticket size was between Rs. 50 lakh to 1 crore. Wint Wealth is trying to democratize fixed-income assets for retail investors who can enter the debt landscape with a ticket size as low as Rs. 10,000.\\n\\nSkin in the game\\n\\nAjinkya is happy about the skin-in-the-game rule announced recently by SEBI. As per the rule, key employees of a mutual fund company will receive 20 per cent salary as fund units. These units will be locked in for three years. He said it is a noteworthy move as it creates skin in the game for people operating the funds.\\n\\nBecause of the new SEBI decision, now if the fund manager has a salary of Rs 1 crore, his/her Rs 20 lakh will be in the schemes they run. Consequently, if the fund underperforms, the fund manager will suffer a personal downside. While if it overperforms, he/she will get rewarded.\\n\\n“The reputation of the fund is always at stake. But when the people operating the fund are investing in the same funds, they have skin in the game – not just financially but also emotionally. If the fund drops 5-10% in value, the fund operator feels emotional pain that drives his/ her decision-making in a true sense. It aligns funds’ and investor’s interests together. In fact, at Wint Wealth, all our team members invest in every asset. Wint Wealth, as an organization, holds 2% of every asset until its maturity,” he said. Wint Wealth has become widely popular with Indian investors. It provides access to a high-yield asset class that was only available to High Net Worth individuals till now. It is a significant step to democratize alternative investments in India and provide diversification opportunities to investors. In this Wint Wealth Review, let us understand the platform in-depth and how you can generate up to 11-12% yield with lesser risks.\\n\\nWhat are Bonds\\n\\nBonds are akin to fixed assets. Bonds, which are financial securities, represent money the issuers owe to their buyers, and the issuer repays the principal amount on maturity and interest until it matures. Majorly, bonds can be of two types:\\n\\nUnsecured Bonds: Unsecured bonds do not include any collateral in the agreement. Let’s say that if the company stops operating or becomes bankrupt, you have fewer chances of recovering your initial investment. Secured Bonds: On the other hand, a secured bond is backed by sufficient collateral. That means if the company stops operating or goes bankrupt, you have the security of getting your investment back.\\n\\nDifferent Types of Bonds\\n\\nBased on the Issuer\\n\\nGovernment Securities\\n\\nThey are also known as G- Secs and are issued by the Central Government to borrow public funds for the country’s development, and they are one of the safest bonds.\\n\\nCorporate Bonds\\n\\nPrivate companies issue these bonds to raise capital to grow, and they offer higher interest rates than G- Secs but also have a higher risk.\\n\\nPublic Sector Bonds\\n\\nPublic Sector Undertakings are issued. These bonds are known as public-sector bonds. These are the companies owned and managed by the government.\\n\\nState Development Loans (SDLs)\\n\\nThe state government issues these bonds to raise funds for the development of the state. The credit risk is lower in these bonds.\\n\\nSovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs)\\n\\nSovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) are bonds backed by assets and are issued by the Central Government. These bonds are denominated in gold, each worth one gram of gold. Investing in gold is an excellent option if you do not want to hold gold physically.\\n\\nTypes of Bonds Based on Nature and Frequency of Interest Payments\\n\\nFixed Rate Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds offer fixed interest rates, pre-determined and paid in regular intervals, which can be annual, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly.\\n\\nFloating Rate Bonds\\n\\nAs the name suggests, the interest rates do not remain fixed in the bond tenure and keep fluctuating depending on a selected benchmark interest rate.\\n\\nZero-Coupon Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds do not provide interest but are issued at a discount of their face value, and while they are matured, they are redeemed at their face value.\\n\\nPerpetual Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds generally take the form of subordinated debt and can also be called because they do not have a maturity date. Still, they pay the pre-determined interest rate to the investor throughout the holding period of the bond.\\n\\n5. Senior Secured Bonds\\n\\nThese bonds get priority rights of getting the payments as compared to the subordinated bonds and loans. Moreover, these bonds have some collateral with them such as property, receivables etc. which could be used in the recovery case of default by the issuer. Investing in Wint Wealth’s Senior Secured Bonds can be a good option if you seek stable returns and a higher level of security than unsecured bonds. In simple words, senior secured bonds mean that if the company goes bankrupt, the senior secured bondholders will have the highest priority and be paid back first.\\n\\nWhat is Wint Wealth?\\n\\nResolution of default is a long and tedious process with a lot of legalities. Each lender is fighting to get their money back which can take years, and in many cases, some processes get stuck in fraud investigation. This is evident from some of the latest defaults like ILFS, DHFL, and Sintex.\\n\\nMore than a year has passed since the ILFS default. Lenders are clueless about how much more time will it take and what will they get after that! To make it worse some of the investors with deep pockets want to get preferential treatment in asset monetization proceedings. Wint Wealth is able to sidestep these problems by creating exclusive collateral for investors using products like Covered Bonds and Senior Secured Bonds.\\n\\nRegister for Free on Wint Wealth\\n\\nWhat is the Wint Wealth Business Model?\\n\\nWint Wealth is a fintech platform that works closely with companies that are looking to raise money. They allow retail investors to invest in innovative products to provide lending to those companies. These products have a lower risk compared to unsecured bonds.\\n\\nTraditionally, these investments were only available to the Ultra HNIs with a ticket size between Rs. 50L to 1Cr. With their high-rated asset-backed debt products, they aim to democratize fixed-income assets for retail investors to enter the debt landscape with a ticket size as low as Rs. 10,000. This helps first-time debt investors to diversify their investments toward debt.\\n\\nWint Wealth has introduced senior secured Bonds/covered bonds for retail investors which provide enhanced security. Wint Wealth products are created to provide\\n\\nFixed/ steady returns (9-12%). Physical collateral like gold, real estate, or vehicles used as collateral Bankruptcy protected framework Low Minimum Investments\\n\\nThe normal cash flow of the Issuer will service the interest payment under business-as-usual circumstances.\\n\\nCashflow from the collateral pool (gold loans, property loans, etc) will be utilized for payment if predefined trigger events occur (eg delay in interest payment)\\n\\nBased on predefined investment criteria (until the start of the principal amortization), the cash flow from the pool will be used to acquire additional loan assets from the issuer so that collateral cover is always present\\n\\nFD is required in some cases for additional collateral\\n\\nWhy Wintwealth?\\n\\nTypically, these kinds of bonds have a very high ticket size, and individual investors cannot invest in these instruments as the minimum investment is INR 10 lakhs.\\n\\nAnother way to invest in these bonds is through mutual funds where the mutual funds invest in these funds but it include their margins and costs. As the tax benefit of these mutual funds has been revoked by the finance ministry bonds have become more attractive.\\n\\nBut all these problems are solved by Wint, as it allows retail investors to invest in these instruments for as low as INR 10,000. You can directly invest in these bonds without intermediaries, which results in higher returns for the investors.\\n\\nWhat are the Features of Wint Wealth?\\n\\nStable Returns: Investing in bonds provides stable returns over time, which is impossible in the stock market. The stock market is known for its unpredictable nature with both significant gains and losses hence investing all your funds in the stock market can be risky. Diversifying some of your funds for fixed returns is an excellent choice for your portfolio as it prevents you from market volatility. Higher Returns than Fixed Deposits: Investing in bonds provide you with 9-11% returns on average which is higher than Fixed Deposits. Secured Investment: Due to multiple instances of financial fraud in the industry, many buyers hesitate to invest directly. Wint Wealth addresses this issue by carefully selecting the most secure investment options from the top businesses, which ensures safe investment.

The founders come with a diverse background in growing digital businesses and a deep understanding of Credit Risk.\\n\\nAjinkya and Abhik are experts in digital business models in the lending and payment space. Shashank has expertise in the technological aspects of the platforms to enhance user experience.\\n\\nThey roped in Anshul Gupta, the 4th founder from Northern Arc which is a pioneer in underwriting innovative credit products which have high yield and robust risk mitigation features.\\n\\nBenefits of Wint Wealth\\n\\nGood Returns: The investment options on Wint Wealth offers you around 9-11% returns on their Senior Secured Bonds, which is a good return in the category of fixed return security. Short Duration: Typically, bonds come with a lock-in period of around 5-8 years, but with Wint Wealth, you can invest for a short term of as low as two years. Listed on the Stock Market: The bonds on Wint Wealth’s platform are listed on the stock market, providing liquidity for the instruments. Fully Regulated: Wint Wealth is regulated by SEBI and RBI, making it a safe and secure platform for investors. Diversification: Investing in bonds allows you to diversify your portfolio and reduce the risk of stock market fluctuations.\\n\\nWint Wealth and Zerodha Connection\\n\\nWint Wealth raised $2Mn in seed funding from high-profile investors. It includes Zerodha, Kunal Shah, and Wazirx founder Nischal Shetty. Wint Wealth funding by Zerodha is through their Rain Matter Fund.\\n\\nRainmatter is a subsidiary of Zerodha. The Bangalore-based incubator provides well-equipped workspaces, mentorship, and funding ($100K-$1M) to innovative startups in the capital markets space in exchange for minority stakes.\\n\\nThey have further received USD 15 Mn led by Eight Road Ventures in May 2022\\n\\nIs Wint Wealth Safe?\\n\\nThere are two aspects of safety in the parlance of investment platforms\\n\\nGenuinity of the platform\\n\\nDeals available on the platform\\n\\nThere is sufficient evidence to suggest the platform is trustworthy and acts in the interest of Investors. It is backed by credible people. The platform takes sufficient steps to educate investors on the deals it introduces for investment\\n\\nThe safety of the deals available on Wint Wealth has to be considered by comparing the products offering similar returns. All future deals on Wint Wealth will be public issues which means they are regulated by SEBI and the platform needs to follow the requisite protocols. Secondly, the assets have an extra layer of security compared to similar NCDs available on the secondary market because of the covered bond feature!\\n\\nRegister for Free on Wint Wealth\\n\\nWint Wealth Risk\\n\\nCredit Risk: In many cases, investors have a fear of their investments becoming worthless if a company fails because there are many cases where unsecured bonds have resulted in huge losses for the investors. But this risk is eliminated by Wint Wealth by listing companies only that have sufficient assets to cover their raised funds. In addition, the platform also offers Amortising Bonds that allow you to retrieve your principal amount in installments over a specific period, further reducing the risk of loss. Risk of Fraud: With the increase in cyber crimes, predicting the chances of fraud is daunting; hence, investors are not very confident with these investment options. But Wint Wealth ensures the complete safety of bonds by selecting and curating the bonds carefully by the experts. Risk of Liquidity: You can invest in bonds whenever they are available. However, you might need help selling them because many bonds do not have liquidity, even if they are listed on the stock exchanges. To reduce the risk, you should invest only the amount you can hold for a fixed period. Wint Wealth offers short-term bonds with a maturity of one to two years with good returns.\\n\\nWintwealth Fees\\n\\nWintwealth does not charge any fees to the investor. The fees are borne by the issuer and hence the return shown to you by the platform are the actual returns available to you as an investor.\\n\\nWint Wealth Vs Golden Pi: A Comparison\\n\\nGoldenPi is another platform backed by Zerodha that allows investors to buy fixed-income securities. Some of the differences between Wint Wealth and Golden Pi are:\\n\\nTicket Size: Golden Pi has most bonds with a minimum investment requirement of INR 10 Lakh which can be high for most investors whereas you can start with INR 10k on Wintwealth Diversification: Wint Wealth allows more diversification as you can create a more granular portfolio using smaller allocations to each bond. Selection of Bonds: You select from bonds based on your risk appetite on Golden Pi, which ranges from high- security with fewer returns to high returns with less security. However, in Wint Wealth, safety and reducing risks in bonds are what the customers look for. Hence the returns remain constant at 9-11% with better security.\\n\\nHow is Wint Wealth Taxed?\\n\\nAll bonds will be taxed as per your income slab hence it makes more sense to invest from an account that is under a lower tax bracket to reduce outgo.\\n\\nHow does Wint Wealth Make Money?\\n\\nWint Wealth charges a percentage of the bonds listed on the websites, the users are not charged, but the Issuers are charged for listing.\\n\\nWint Wealth- 2 Years of Experience\\n\\nMy investment experience with Wint Wealth was smooth. The platform is user-friendly, and a return of at least 9-11% can be expected with limited risk. I have invested in more than 7 opportunities listed on Wintwealth over the last 2 years.\\n\\nSome of the bonds I invested in were\\n\\nOxyzo\\n\\nSlice\\n\\nAryadhan\\n\\nIIFL\\n\\nWint Wealth Sovereign Gold Bonds\\n\\nWint Wealth has a great feature that allows you to buy sovereign gold bonds at a steep discount from Face value. The reason for that is many times these listed bonds are trading at a discount due to selling by other investors.\\n\\nA sovereign gold bond is one of the best products for investing in gold as it is backed by the government. You get additional 2.5% fixed returns and the capital gains are tax-free at maturity. I use Wint for purchasing Sovereign Gold Bond whenever gold value drops to average my returns.\\n\\nWint Wealth Alternatives\\n\\nThere are many platforms that can be used to complement Wint Wealth. Grip Invest is one platform that provides access to Bonds and Leasing Investment and provided 20-21% IRR. Another Wint Wealth Alternative is TradeCred which is a marketplace for Invoice Discounting.\\n\\nPeople can also explore Klubworks for revenue-based Financing. Lendbox and Leafround have also come up with interesting products with stable returns and low risk.\\n\\nTo get more exposure to other opportunities in High Yield Debt you can explore Jiraaf. A list of some of the platforms you can evaluate is\\n\\nAltifi Jiraaf Grip Invest Klubwork Lendbox Tradecred\\n\\nAlternative Investment List\\n\\nWintwealth Login\\n\\nTo find out all the investment opportunities and products offered by Wint Wealth, you need to login into the platform.

They have different use cases for everyone. For a young urban investor, a fixed deposit could be the way to park emergency funds or hold windfall gains to meet a short-term requirement. A family in a tier 2-3 town may opt for an FD to plan their children\\'s education.\\n\\nAs per RBI data, the total market size of retail fixed deposits in the country was more than Rs 51 lakh crore as of June and growing at 7-8 percent per annum. Currently, the interest rates on FDs are at the highest level in the last 10 years. Thus, the time is ripe to build a product that empowers retail investors to book FDs easily and safely.\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nStory continues below Advertisement Remove Ad\\n\\nNBFCs and small finance banks offer 1-2 percent interest arbitrage on FDs over their established banking peers. So, there is a very strong value proposition for retail investors. However, these NBFCs and small finance banks lack the digital infrastructure for distribution. We solve this problem by onboarding them on our platform and providing a seamless user experience.\\n\\nAlso read: MC exclusive: Centre plans OFS in defence, railway, fertiliser, coal PSUs to meet minimum public shareholding\\n\\nHow do you intend to make money selling FDs?\\n\\nWe will earn 50-100 basis points distribution commission from NBFCs and small finance banks. Being a mass product, we can build a sustainable revenue stream from FD distribution. Moreover, there are many opportunities to cross-sell other financial products to investors.\\n\\nHow has the business grown since SEBI introduced regulations for OBPPs last year?\\n\\nThe regulation has certainly improved the sense of trust among our investors. However, business growth has been moderate because the minimum face value of listed debt securities under private placement is still Rs 1 lakh. It means that to build a diversified bond portfolio, retail investors need a minimum of Rs 5-6 lakh. Not many retail investors can afford such hefty investments in corporate bonds.\\n\\nEarlier, the SEBI Chairman indicated that the ticket size would be reduced further. We are hopeful that it will be done soon. In the meantime, we are solving the diversification problem through our basket of bonds, which allows investors to invest in bonds from 7-8 NBFCs with Rs 1 lakh investment. Having said that, the OBPP industry cannot expect any meaningful growth before the ticket size is brought down substantially.\\n\\nAlso read: Bob World app case: A look at the issue and the regulatory action it triggered\\n\\nHow do you plan to shape the business from here on? Are there any other product lines that you intend to add?\\n\\nOur impetus is building Wint Wealth as the easiest and safest platform to book fixed deposits. Currently, investors can book Bajaj Finance FDs from our platform. By next week, we will also have FDs from Fincare Small Finance Bank on our platform.\\n\\nOver the next 12 months, we will onboard all the small finance banks on our platform to widen the choice of FDs with the best interest rates. At the same time, we will continue to identify and bring high-quality corporate bonds, curated bond baskets, and sovereign gold bonds on our platform to help invest and create a diversified debt portfolio.\\n\\nWhat is your outlook on funding for fintech startups? Any plans to raise Series B funding?\\n\\nApart from the ongoing funding winter, the fintech industry faces additional regulatory risks as well. So, until the regulations play out completely, investors will be cautious in taking new bets.\\n\\nWe have always been prudent in our operational expenditure and preferred growing organically as much as possible. We still have more funds in our bank account than we raised in the Series A round. Therefore, we are well capitalised for the next 3-4 years. We are targeting to be EBIDTA positive over the next 12-18 months. As of now, there are no plans to raise more capital. If there are any meaningful offers next year onwards, we will decide on a case-to-case basis. Wint Wealth, an alternative debt asset platform for retail investors, recently launched ‘Wint Bricks Nov21’ - a senior secured bonds issue from U GROW Capital (Ugrow), a non-banking financial company.\\n\\nThe bonds are offering an attractive 10.50 per cent (XIRR) for a little over a two-year tenure. You can invest as little as ₹10,000 which is a small ticket size for bond investments. The return is particularly enticing when seen in the context of the falling interest rates on bank fixed deposits.\\n\\nBut the higher returns obviously come with commensurate risk. Do your homework before you take the plunge. Here, we highlight the key points about this bond issue.\\n\\nWhat bonds are on offer\\n\\nCo-founded in November 2019 by two financial services industry professionals, Wint Wealth (earlier GrowFix) is a fixed income investment platform for retail investors. Excluding the latest offering, Wint Bricks Nov21, the platform has so far offered seven bond issues totalling ₹100 crore.\\n\\nThe latest one, Wint Bricks Nov21 is a ₹50 crore senior secured bond issue from Ugrow, an NBFC focused on lending to small businesses (more details later). These bonds have been bought by Wint Wealth and other wholesale buyers (or warehousing partners, as they are called) from Ugrow in a primary issue and are now being made available for sale to retail investors on the Wint Wealth platform.\\n\\nThe bonds mature in 27 months and are offering a return (XIRR or extended internal rate of return) of 10.50 per cent. Investors will receive monthly interest on the bonds and will be repaid 33 per cent of their principal every 9 months (see table for details). That one doesn’t have to wait until maturity to receive the entire principal is a positive on the risk front.\\n\\nThough, as part principal repayments are made, the monthly interest income is bound to go down.\\n\\nUsually investment returns are indicated in the form of CAGR (compound annual growth rate). But, in case of investments involving multiple inflows / outflows (periodic interest and principal repayment in the case of the Ugrow bonds) at different times throughout the investment period, XIRR and not CAGR provides the correct return calculation.\\n\\nThe Ugrow bonds are ‘senior secured’ which essentially means that they are secured by way of collateral (assets) on which the bondholders have exclusive charge. In this case, the Rs. 50 crore issue has been collateralized by ₹62.5 crore worth of property loans. The bonds are rated A (Positive) by Acuite Ratings.\\n\\nAny individual with a demat account can buy these bonds either on the Wint Wealth platform or directly through their brokerage account. Even when you invest via the platform, the order is still placed through the broker and executed on the exchange. Note that, there is a temporary halt in the sale of these bonds and these are expected to be available for sale from December 1. These bonds are listed on the BSE and the NSE. Investors are not charged for transactions on the platform.\\n\\nWhile the returns are enticing and buying the bonds too appears easy, let these not be the deciding factors for investing in them.\\n\\nAlso read: Nuts and bolts of Retail Direct Gilt account\\n\\nMultiple risks\\n\\nWhile the bond issue is backed by adequate collateral, the issue has a relatively low credit rating of A from Acuite Ratings and calls for caution. The highest-rated safest bonds are assigned a AAA rating.\\n\\nUgrow is a relatively new NBFC specializing in SME lending that began loan disbursements only in January 2019. It had assets under management of only ₹1,933 crore as of September 2021. Sector-wise, light engineering and food processing alone account for 40 per cent of its loan book. While the company’s net NPA (non-performing assets) of 1.8 per cent appears low, this is likely reflecting the impact of loan restructuring (7.2 per cent of its portfolio) undertaken by it in the September 2021 quarter.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the collateral, what matters is how liquid it is. In this case, the issue is backed by Ugrow’s property loans. As long as the majority of the borrowers keep servicing their loans, the collateral (property loans) can offer support in the event of any default on the bonds. But, if there were to be a spike in loan defaults, then even though the underlying property can be confiscated, liquidating it to pay off the bondholders can turn out to be a time-consuming process.\\n\\nAlso, while it may be easy to buy the Ugrow bonds now, selling them before maturity may not so, due to lack of sufficient buyers. So, one must be prepared to hold these bonds until maturity.>'"
