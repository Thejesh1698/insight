    "\n",
    "\"Private consumption growth is likely to slow as the post-pandemic catch up fades, and external demand for India’s exports will be affected by slowing growth in major trading partners, including the EU,\" the World Bank said in its India Development Outlook, citing public investment in infrastructure as a significant driver of growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "India's economy grew 7.8% in the first quarter of the fiscal owing to strong domestic demand. However, the multilateral lender said that domestic demand will remain robust but at a slower pace.\n",

    "It further noted that oil, even though lower than the peaks witnessed during 2022, also remained a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "India's inflation eased marginally to 6.8% in August compared with the 15-month high of 7.4% hit in July. Experts indicate it is expected to ease further in September.\n",

    "\"The RBI’s policy of withdrawing accommodation and raising the policy interest rate over the last year has helped rein-in core inflation, which is expected to continue to decelerate gradually,\" the World Bank said.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RBI's Monetary Policy Committee will decide on the policy rate, which has been held at 6.5% since February, later this week.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the fiscal side, the World Bank projected a slight improvement, with the general government deficit declining to 8.7% in FY24 from 9% of the Gross Domestic Product in the previous fiscal. However, it pointed out that subsidy programmes, ahead of 2024 general elections could weigh on fiscal roadmap.\n",
    "\n",

    "Bihar caste survey: What it means for BJP, Congress, JDU, RJD & how it will affect 2024 polls\n",
    "To navigate this challanging terrain, the BJP must employ astute political maneuvering. The party is studying the caste-based headcount and hopes that the central leadership will address recommendations regarding reservation quotas. The six-party grand alliance and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) pose challenges, and the BJP may need to court smaller parties and strengthen alliances to expand its electoral base.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a scenario that demands political finesse, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) finds itself at a crossroads in Bihar as the latest caste survey data raises questions about its electoral prospects in the upcoming 2024 parliamentary elections. The state boasts 40 parliamentary constituencies, and the BJP is keen to replicate its stellar performance from 2019 when, in alliance with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) led by the late Ram Vilas Paswan, it secured a resounding victory by capturing 39 seats.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a brewing controversy initiated by Anand Mohan, the former Bihar People's Party (BPP) chief, who was convicted in the 1994 murder of the Gopalganj District Magistrate G. Krishnaiya, has set the stage for a potential clash among Brahmins and Thakurs/Rajputs in Bihar. This friction arises from the recitation of the poem \"Thakur Ka Kuan\" by RJD MP Manoj Kumar Jha in the Rajya Sabha. To navigate this sensitive terrain, the BJP must employ astute political maneuvering, as observers opine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Samrat Chaudhary, the state chief of the BJP, echoed the sentiments of the party's senior leaders, saying, \"We will first study and analyze the details of the caste-based headcount, and then make our statement on policy perspectives.\" Meanwhile, the state leadership is in communication with Union Home Minister Amit Shah, hoping that the central leadership will address the Rohini Commission's recommendations regarding the equitable allocation of reservation quotas among backward castes and EBCs in central government jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this complex political landscape, the BJP's unease presents an opportunity for the six-party grand alliance comprising the Janata Dal (United), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and three Left parties. Their challenge lies in the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), led by Asaduddin Owaisi, who secured six assembly seats in the 2020 state elections. Owaisi's polarizing ideology could potentially erode a portion of their Muslim support base, despite the fact that five of the six AIMIM MLAs later joined the RJD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, the BJP in Bihar may need to go the extra mile to court smaller parties outside the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), such as the Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), led by former minister Mukesh Sahani. Sahani represents caste-based groups like the Kewats (boatmen) and Mallahs (fishermen), constituting 3.3% of the population. Building stronger alliances with supporting parties also becomes crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, Mayawati, the chief of the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), commands support among the Chamar (cobbler) and Mochi castes within the Scheduled Caste segment, accounting for 5.3% of the total population. While Mayawati's party is not part of the NDA, her influence could significantly impact the BJP's electoral strategy in Bihar. In the face of these intricate caste dynamics, the BJP faces a formidable challenge in maintaining and expanding its electoral base ahead of the 2024 elections.\n",

Keep the key points only and don\\'t repeat headline as is. \\nHeadline: World Bank raises India\\'s inflation forecast to 5.9% for FY24 on higher oil prices, abnormal monsoon\\nContent: The World Bank has kept India\\'s growth forecast unchanged at 6.3% for FY24, citing investment as a significant driver. However, it has revised its inflation projection to 5.9% from 5.2%. It also notes that inflation is likely to spike more than expected due to abnormal rainfall and the concern over oil prices.\\n\\nIshaan Gera\\nThe World Bank Tuesday kept India\\'s growth forecast unchanged at 6.3% for FY24, driven by investment, while sharply revising its inflation projection to 5.9% from 5.2%.\\n\\n\"Private consumption growth is likely to slow as the post-pandemic catch up fades, and external demand for India’s exports will be affected by slowing growth in major trading partners, including the EU,\" the World Bank said in its India Development Outlook, citing public investment in infrastructure as a significant driver of growth.\\n\\nIndia\\'s economy grew 7.8% in the first quarter of the fiscal owing to strong domestic demand. However, the multilateral lender said that domestic demand will remain robust but at a slower pace.\\n\\n\"Private consumption growth is likely to taper off as post-pandemic pent-up demand fades and high food price inflation constrains demand, particularly for low-income households,\" it noted.\\n\\nThe Washington-headquartered multilateral lender pointed out that inflation is likely spike more than expected at 5.9% in FY24, closer to the upper limit of Reserve Bank of India\\'s target of 2-6%.\\n\\n\"Abnormal rainfall during the monsoon months caused a sharp increase in food prices in July 2023. Though eased in August, it is expected to continue to weigh on headline inflation through the rest of the fiscal year,\" the World Bank said.\\n\\nIt further noted that oil, even though lower than the peaks witnessed during 2022, also remained a concern.\\n\\nIndia\\'s inflation eased marginally to 6.8% in August compared with the 15-month high of 7.4% hit in July. Experts indicate it is expected to ease further in September.\\n\\n\"The RBI’s policy of withdrawing accommodation and raising the policy interest rate over the last year has helped rein-in core inflation, which is expected to continue to decelerate gradually,\" the World Bank said.\\n\\nThe RBI\\'s Monetary Policy Committee will decide on the policy rate, which has been held at 6.5% since February, later this week.\\n\\nOn the fiscal side, the World Bank projected a slight improvement, with the general government deficit declining to 8.7% in FY24 from 9% of the Gross Domestic Product in the previous fiscal. However, it pointed out that subsidy programmes, ahead of 2024 general elections could weigh on fiscal roadmap.\\n\\n\"Although fiscal intervention has been limited so far, fiscal consolidation could be delayed by subsidy programs to limit the impact of high food prices on vulnerable households ahead of the general elections in 2024,\" it said.\\n\\nLast month, the government announced a Rs 200 subsidy on LPG cylinders for all households.\\n\\nThe World Bank forecasted public debt to stabilise around 83% of GDP in FY24, falling to 82.4% in FY25.\\n\\nIn line with others\\nThe World Bank forecast is in line with other projections of GDP growth. S&P Global Ratings, recently, maintained India\\'s growth at 6%, sharply revising its inflation numbers.\\n\\nFitch, another rating agency, also maintained India\\'s growth forecast, whereas Asian Development Bank, revised the forecast downwards to 6.3%.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India forecasts growth to average 6.5% in FY24.\\n\\nThe World Bank projects growth to rise to 6.4% in FY25 and inflation to fall to 4.7%.\\n'"
