       "['headline: AI cant substitute human intelligence in adjudication: Delhi HC.  content: Artificial intelligence (AI) can substitute neither the human intelligence nor the humane element in the adjudicatory process the Delhi High Court has held and said ChatGPT cant be the basis of adjudication of legal or factual issues in a court of law. Justice Prathiba M Singh stated that the accuracy and reliability of AI generated data is still in the grey area and at best such a tool can be utilised for a preliminary understanding or for preliminary research.  The courts observations came while dealing with a lawsuit by luxury brand Christian Louboutin against a partnership firm involved in the manufacture and sale of shoes allegedly in violation of its trademark.  The counsel for the plaintiff submitted that  Red Sole Shoe  was its registered trademark in India and placed before court responses by ChatGPT with respect to its  reputation .   The said tool (ChatGPT) cannot be the basis of adjudication of legal or factual issues in a court of law. The response of a Large Language Model (LLM) based chatbots such as ChatGPT which is sought to be relied upon by the Counsel for the Plaintiff depends upon a host of factors including the nature and structure of query put by the user the training data etc. Further there are possibilities of incorrect responses fictional case laws imaginative data etc. generated by AI chatbots  said the court in a recent order.   Accuracy and reliability of AI generated data is still in the grey area. There is no doubt in the mind of the Court that at the present stage of technological development AI cannot substitute either the human intelligence or the humane element in the adjudicatory process. At best the tool could be utilised for a preliminary understanding or for preliminary research and nothing more  the court observed.  Based on the comparative analysis of the products of the two parties the court ultimately ruled that the defendant had a  clear intention to imitate and gain monetarily on the strength of the reputation and goodwill  of the plaintiff.   This Court has no doubt that the products of the Defendant are knock-offs or look-alikes of the Plaintiffs distinctive shoes and footwear. The Defendant has copied all the essential features of the Plaintiffs footwear such as Red Sole Spiked Shoe Style as also the prints. The imitation is not of one or two designs but of a large number of designs as the chart above indicates  the court said.  The defendant agreed to undertake that it shall not copy or imitate any of the designs of the plaintiffs shoes and the court directed that in case of any breach of this undertaking the defendant would be liable to pay Rs 25 lakh as damages to the plaintiff.  Considering that the defendant was also using the pictures of well-known Bollywood celebrities on its Instagram account and also displayed/sold the shoes in high-end malls it was directed that the defendant shall pay a sum of Rs 2 lakh as costs to the plaintiff.',\n",

       " 'headline: CJI cautions against misusing tech social media and AI for harmful purposes says human values and justi.  content: Chennai: Technology especially one fostering quicker communication to a larger spectrum of audiences such as social media and artificial intelligence (AI) which has permeated all sectors should create affordances against misuse because human values and individual privacy are of paramount importance Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud said here on Saturday. Contending that  new technology cannot exist in a vacuum  and hence has to be made benign with safeguards for affable use the CJI said technology should facilitate reliable use without causing any trepidation among the people about the possible breach of their personal liberty.  Social media has allowed us to connect with people removing barriers of age and nationality. But this new communication tool has led to new behaviour like online abuse and trolling. Likewise AI contains the potential for misuse mislead threaten or even bully individuals. Curbing its misuse for harmful purposes will be among the key challenges for you  he said addressing the graduating students at the 60th convocation of IIT Madras. Technology should not create fear in the minds of users through online abuse or harassment. An impact of AI recruitment tools is that it appeared to show discrimination or bias he claimed.  Today I want to leave you with two questions that I hope you will ask yourselves. What are the value your technology represents and what are its affordances  Justice Chandrachud asked.  When I say value I do not mean the monetary worth of your ideas innovations or technology. I mean what principled values the technology represents and in particular what are the values it furthers in the context you seek to deploy it  he said.  Keep in mind what values a particular AI represents and what affordances it creates  the CJI said. Emphasising how technology could be put to good use he said during the Covid-19 pandemic the Supreme Court held 43 million virtual hearings and courts across the country too held similar virtual hearings to facilitate the lawyers and litigants to appear before the courts for disposal of cases and thus paved the way for  inclusivity and access to justice  he said. Another instance was to conduct  tele law  facility which benefitted in providing legal services to the people particularly women and children. Going a step further the apex court has now launched AI system for transcription of live proceedings on an experimental basis the CJI said. He said no technology can be neutral if deployed in a real-world context. Technological use has to fulfil and represent some human values.  Therefore values matter. Science and technology can empower us to secure our liberty equality and social justice  he said and added that our Constitution laid down the basis for rights and liberties for growth. A total of 2571 students graduated during the 60th convocation and 453 doctorate degrees including 19 for joint degrees with foreign universities received their degree certificates. IIT Madras has become the first institute in the country to establish its international campus in Zanzibar (Tanzania) for four-year MS and two-year BS courses in data science and AI said IIT-M Director V Kamakoti. Pawan Goenka chairperson Board of Governors IIT Madras said the institutes spending on research activities increased to Rs 1000 crore now from about Rs 250 crore in the past.',\n",
       " 'headline: Will AI really destroy humanity.  content: The warnings are coming from all angles: artificial intelligence poses an existential risk to humanity and must be shackled before it is too late. But what are these disaster scenarios and how are machines supposed to wipe out humanity - Paperclips of doom - Most disaster scenarios start in the same place: machines will outstrip human capacities escape human control and refuse to be switched off.  Once we have machines that have a self-preservation goal we are in trouble  AI academic Yoshua Bengio told an event this month. But because these machines do not yet exist imagining how they could doom humanity is often left to philosophy and science fiction. Philosopher Nick Bostrom has written about an  intelligence explosion  he says will happen when superintelligent machines begin designing machines of their own. He illustrated the idea with the story of a superintelligent AI at a paperclip factory. The AI is given the ultimate goal of maximising paperclip output and so  proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks of the observable universe into paperclips . Bostroms ideas have been dismissed by many as science fiction not least because he has separately argued that humanity is a computer simulation and supported theories close to eugenics. He also recently apologised after a racist message he sent in the 1990s was unearthed. Yet his thoughts on AI have been hugely influential inspiring both Elon Musk and Professor Stephen Hawking. - The Terminator - If superintelligent machines are to destroy humanity they surely need a physical form. Arnold Schwarzeneggers red-eyed cyborg sent from the future to end human resistance by an AI in the movie  The Terminator  has proved a seductive image particularly for the media. But experts have rubbished the idea.  This science fiction concept is unlikely to become a reality in the coming decades if ever at all  the Stop Killer Robots campaign group wrote in a 2021 report. However the group has warned that giving machines the power to make decisions on life and death is an existential risk. Robot expert Kerstin Dautenhahn from Waterloo University in Canada played down those fears. She told AFP that AI was unlikely to give machines higher reasoning capabilities or imbue them with a desire to kill all humans.  Robots are not evil  she said although she conceded programmers could make them do evil things. - Deadlier chemicals - A less overtly sci-fi scenario sees  bad actors  using AI to create toxins or new viruses and unleashing them on the world. Large language models like GPT-3 which was used to create ChatGPT it turns out are extremely good at inventing horrific new chemical agents.  A group of scientists who were using AI to help discover new drugs ran an experiment where they tweaked their AI to search for harmful molecules instead. They managed to generate 40000 potentially poisonous agents in less than six hours as reported in the Nature Machine Intelligence journal. AI expert Joanna Bryson from the Hertie School in Berlin said she could imagine someone working out a way of spreading a poison like anthrax more quickly.  But its not an existential threat  she told AFP.  Its just a horrible awful weapon.  - Species overtaken - The rules of Hollywood dictate that epochal disasters must be sudden immense and dramatic -- but what if humanitys end was slow quiet and not definitive  At the bleakest end our species might come to an end with no successor  philosopher Huw Price says in a promotional video for Cambridge Universitys Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.  But he said there were  less bleak possibilities  where humans augmented by advanced technology could survive.  The purely biological species eventually comes to an end in that there are no humans around who dont have access to this enabling technology  he said. The imagined apocalypse is often framed in evolutionary terms. Stephen Hawking argued in 2014 that ultimately our species will no longer be able to compete with AI machines telling the BBC it could  spell the end of the human race . Geoffrey Hinton who spent his career building machines that resemble the human brain latterly for Google talks in similar terms of  superintelligences  simply overtaking humans. He told US broadcaster PBS recently that it was possible  humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence .',\n",
       " 'headline: Courts and law enforcement need to build AI capabilities  Mint.  content:  Brad Smith Microsofts vice-chairman and president highlighted the crucial role artificial intelligence (AI) is set to play in our lives at work and beyond at the B20 India Summit. In an interview during his visit to Delhi Smith said India is one of Microsofts fastest-growing markets driven by digital transformation in the past decade. He also said that though there are numerous opportunities in generative AI there is clearly a hype cycle around it. Besides he reiterated the companys readiness to navigate the multiple regulations on AI in India and touched upon Microsofts cybersecurity skilling initiatives. He said Indias new regulations may alter the future trajectory of Big Tech. Edited excerpts: Statistically what is Indias share in Microsofts operations No one should have any doubt about the importance of Indiawhether it is about Microsoft or other tech companies. It is one of the fastest-growing markets for Microsoft globally. That is a reflection of this enormous spurt in digital growth India has been on for the last five yearsit has accelerated and shows no sign of abating. Its good for India and certainly good for us. That said we dont give a geography-wise breakdown of our numbers. What kind of AI regulations are needed across countries and what would Microsoft want from India There are many existing laws and regulations that we should all remember will be applicable. For instance if its unlawful to defraud someone then its also unlawful to use AI to do that. No one can go before a judge and blame a technology. First is to ensure courts and law enforcement agencies develop AI skills and capabilities to evaluate it. It also means that organizations subject to these laws must develop capability to use AI properly. Thats a broad goal and is a critical starting point. Then comes AI foundation or frontier models. Thats where things will get a little more challenging from the perspective that people will have to decide what kind of regulation they want. We must put safety as a very high priority and one of the things it needs is proper testing when the models are developed. Standards are emerging with the use of AI Red Teamsindependent teams evaluating the models to identify risks and state whether the steps taken to mitigate the risks are successful. There must also be some level of global standardization or reciprocity (of regulation). I dont think one would be well served to have every country in the G20 asking a Red Team to work differently. Theres a role that national activity would play but with global coordination. Microsoft will have to deal with a host of new and upcoming regulations that are still evolving. How are you preparing for it Life is understandably getting more complicated for the tech sector. On balance its probably a good thing. It is part of the maturation of the tech sector. Weve been working on it. Two years ago we launched an initiative focusing on what we call regulatory governance. We asked what will be most applicable to our kinds of technology For most areas we have ended looking at financial services which are very well and carefully regulated but allow ongoing innovation and growth. Similarly we could have know-your-cloud obligation to ensure these advanced applications and models are running secure cloud environments. There could be a know-your-content regulation. People will really know the outcome when all regulations are in place. However the fundamental formula India has adopted for privacy is sound. The focus is on the role of data fiduciaries in terms of their responsibility and the role of consent. A question being asked increasingly is if theres regulation of AI then where should it be done At an applications level I would say do it where its already done. In other words if its financial services or healthcare you look to those sectors regulators for these models. Were more positive about the notion of having a specialized regulatoraircraft are regulated by an aviation regulator and automobiles are regulated by an automobile regulator. Its all based on understanding the specifics of the technology. So I dont think its implausible or radical to say that a new technology might just be best governed by a new regulator for that technology. The answer will vary in different countries but having that conversation is useful. In a country like India or elsewhere in the global south one tends to see IT ministries that are closer to being able to be that technology regulator than what you see in Europe or North America. This is where I feel that governments now tend to leapfrog older governments. What are the concerns of generative AI being weaponized and used in cyber warfare and what can Microsoft do about it I think theres a lot that we can do. There are areas where criminals undoubtedly turned to AI like any technology to create stronger weapons. Im probably more concerned in the area of deepfakes or cyber influence operations. Yet the more work we do in this space the more I fundamentally believe that if we invest with ambition we can use this technology to build stronger defences at a pace that is faster than people can weaponize it. Take disinformation that one has to worry about in the context and political campaignsAI can enable people to move faster or produce something better but the truth is they can produce a lot today. I think what we really need to do is embrace the opportunity to harness the power of AI to identify patterns and data because were awash with data. A lot unfortunately happens in plain sight today so the ability to sift through that data for us to find things faster to alert the public to combat itI think that is going to be a bigger game-changer than the advances in weaponry. Is it a concern that we do not have enough skilled resources in cyber security Its definitely a challenge and that is why were investing so much in cyber security skilling programs including in India. We should be able to catch up (with the shortage) because these are very good jobsthey tend to be well-paid and we need to double-down on that. But wherever you have a labour shortage AI probably has more potential than in other areas because its such a productivity enhancer. This is all the more reason for us to lean into the opportunity to use AI to strengthen our ability to protect against something like cyber security threats. Does Microsoft have a specific plan to build the capacity of skilled cyber security professionals even in India We have specific plans yes and in fact programs that we have been implementing here in India. One of the things I was really encouraged by when I was here a year ago was to meet some of the people in our cyber security skilling programs. In particular the meeting that I remember the most in terms of being the most inspiring was to see young women who had specifically enrolled from tier-II and tier-III cities. They had quickly mastered the cyber security skills needed. Part of the solution is to do a better job as an industry of recruiting women and making them feel very welcome. Thats going to be true for cyber security and it is going to be true for AI as well. We need to partner with more non-profits and encourage the government to increase its investment level. This is one problem that we can advance and address more quickly by bringing in more resources. There is a lot of fragmentation in the way tech develops. When we look at generative AI is there a possibility for companies to come together to collaborate and build unified standards to address the collective issues I think there is. Theres a Frontier Model Forum (announced by Microsoft Google OpenAI and others on 26 July) that weve created with a small number of companies and it will grow. We need to recognize that theres a common approach to safety standards that we really need. If you look at us and Googlewe compete vigorously every day and yet we have come together. Thats the type of thing we need to encourage. It also helps when people in governments bring us together because its not a natural act. This is where the White House in the US has played a critical role in bringing us together and well probably benefit if the government leaders in particular capitals continue to do that. Does it worry Microsoft that some of the common narrative on AI is being overhyped and the promises of that may not be that realistic Also taking Azure and its success into account how important is India as a market for Microsoft India is an extremely important market for Microsoft and inevitably it will become even more important every single year. Ultimately we live in a world where GDP will correlate with population. As countries grow economically and we see economic growth become more broadly distributed around the world the single best predictor of GDP a decade from now is population. India has already made the leap to turn that into reality . While Indias digital transformation started nearly two decades ago in this decade India has digitally accelerated at a completely different pace. I do think that AI is a game-changer but I also think that there has been a hype cycle and AI is not necessarily something that serves everybody. Look at the past six monthsaround the world we went from looking at generative AI as something that actually works to something that will save the world to something that will destroy us all. The truth is its not going to save humanity or destroy humanity. It is a tool one that we need to learn how to use and invest in improving. It is a tool that can play a profoundly impactful role over timein providing what could be the greatest technological advance of our lifetime. It can help us pursue new drug discovery improving education and really advancing productivity. But its not going to replace the need for people to think. People who learn how to use it will think better. It definitely can enhance our capacity to create think critically express ourselves and analyse data. It has enormous potential but there is a hype cycle. What is your perception of how India has changed over the past five to seven years Theres no country in the world that moved as rapidly during the pandemic to spread the adoption of digital technology. This is obviously represented in the digital public infrastructure (DPI) you have here. You do not see anything like that scale anywhere else in the world. To some degree thats not surprising given the size of the population but even if you just do it as a percentage of the population and see how many people it has reached it is extraordinary. Adding to that is the vibrancy of the startup community in Indiawhat we call digital natives or companies born in the cloud. That has exploded. Im very struck by the degree to which innovation and technical skilling is reaching into the tier-II and tier-III cities. You add those advances in digital technology with demographic factors that are unique to Indiaone of every four people of working age between the ages of 20 and 64 lives here. Maybe more than any other country on planet Earth the influence of India through its people doesnt stop at its border. There is a massive number of talented people from India who live around the world who have taken engineering or skills they first acquired here and are now connected not just back with India but with each other globally. What really explains why Indians have been able to adopt the digital journey with the entire India Stack faster and better than any other nation Part of the explanation is the very large number of people who have gotten an engineering backgroundnearly half a million of them are being added in India every year. Whenever you have a population with that kind of foundation it helps you spread technology adoption more broadly. But theres a second aspectaround the world youll not only encounter Indians who are local successes but they also tend to be involved in their communities and civically. If you go to the Midwest in the United States in smaller cities or towns if there is a community effort to raise money for a new hospital youre highly likely to find someone from Indiawho has succeeded in the local business communityplaying a role. Theres clearly something in the ethos here that encourages civic-mindedness. In some ways thats bigger than the technology phenomenon. ',\n",

       " 'headline: Our response to AI could change Geoffrey Hintons mind  Mint.  content:  This week of all people Geoffrey Hinton sort of walked out on artificial intelligence (AI) the very technology he helped develop. He fears that companies like Microsoft and Google aggressively competing to create products based on generative artificial intelligence the technology that powers popular chatbots like ChatGPT are racing towards danger. Earlier too inventors have distanced themselves from the very technologies they helped create. Alfred Nobel the inventor of dynamite and J. Robert Oppenheimer associated with the atom bomb were upset with the destructive use of the technologies they helped develop. In each of these cases their walkouts gave rise to significant movements: the Nobel prize and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Hintons reaction is a reminder to the AI industry that they need to take immediate steps to allay growing fears around the industry. AI companies will do well to remember what happened to the nuclear energy industry. The truth is that nuclear power generation has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated among various sources of it. So far there have only been three major accidents in the industry only one of which was catastrophic. But with each accident the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the Fukushima disaster in 2011 exaggerated and irrational fears over the industry grew and the emotional distance with end users widened beyond repair. Does the AI industry have the wherewithal to face a possible Chernobyl like disaster caused by its technology The AI industry can build a bright future for itself not just by mitigating its ill effects but by building on its positives. It can learn a lesson or two from the automotive industry. All the ills that it creates in the world from road accidents to carbon emissions are effectively counteracted by playing up its core benefit: the joy of road transportation. These days there is much jubilation about the AI industry especially since the release of ChatGPT. But this enthusiasm for generative AI is unlikely to last long. This jubilation is only about the creation and initial usage of the product. For this glow to last for a long time generative AI technology has to move to a crucial stage: of adoption with its products in sustained use. Huge enthusiasm at the creation stage does not always translate to sustained usage of a new product. ChatGPT is not a machine whose use is dictated by its calibrations. It is more like a tool which in the hands of a dextrous user can produce usable output. The sustained adoption of this new technology will greatly be determined by the quality of what it generates in response to our requirements. So it is imperative that users of ChatGPT are equipped to use it as effectively as possible. Individuals who work in a creative industry like advertising know that the quality of the creative output is as good as the quality of the strategic brief provided to the creative team. Soon companies like Google and the Chinese tech giant Baidu are going to launch their own versions of generative AI tools. What will act as a clear differentiator in the generative AI space is the quality of prompts provided to generative AI tools. Those equipped to provide intelligent creative prompts will get the best returns from these tools. Advertising agencies usually deploy another strategy to further improve the quality of their creative output: competition. Often multiple internal creative teams are asked to work on the same strategic brief. This internal competition brings out the best in most people. Taking a cue from this idea can the output of the neural networks that ChatGPT relies on be used to fire up real neurons in the human brain Can the output of generative AI for example be treated as a benchmark for humans to beat Humans have always reacted positively to challenges that new technologies have thrown at them. For example the most prominent artistic movement in Europe in the early part of the 19th century as industry arose was realism. Representation with the least possible distortion of reality was its focus. Around this time the technology of photography was also invented forever changing the nature of visual representation. Photographs could create images that were far more realistic than the best any human artist could paint. So how did human artists and portrait makers deal with this competition from the new technology of photography. Painters started began to explore new directions of artistic expression using various dimensions of painting. The artistic movement Impressionism was the first to deviate from the realistic norm. Impressionist painters like Monets focused on conveying the essence of a scene through colour light movement and emotions. Expressionism as an art movement emerged to express the meaning of emotional experiences rather than physical reality. In Cubism subjects were analysed broken up and reassembled in an abstract form with multiple perspectives instead of depicting objects from a single perspective. There was also Surrealistic art which allowed the unconscious mind to express itself on a canvas. The emergence of photography as a technology gave rise to so many great artists like Vincent Van Gogh Pablo Picasso Salvador Dal and many more who transformed the way we think about art. If so just imagine the human potential that could be unleashed to take on the power of a technology like generative AI. Geoffrey Hinton would then end up proud of this development.

       " 'headline: How Conversational Analytics Can Help Banks Better Understand Their Customers  Mint.  content:  For decades companies have been documenting customer conversations as they recognise the significance of these dialogues. This is not only for improved understanding of customer intent but also to gauge and enhance customer service efficacy. Nonetheless the copious unstructured information stored within call logs of customer contact centres presents a challenge in extracting meaningful insights. The banking sector today is under pressure to innovate and remain pertinent in a swiftly changing environment marked by augmented competition from fintech startups  digital transformation and an emphasis on customer experience. In this scenario banks are striving to adapt and remain competitive. They have endeavoured to integrate artificial intelligence into their operations particularly evident in the utilisation of chatbot assistants to manage customer inquiries. Although this has yielded cost savings these chatbots frequently fail to offer effective solutions causing unfavourable user experiences that can detrimentally affect customer contentment and allegiance over time. Due to outdated technology and ineffective utilisation of static unstructured data these chatbots persist in utilising an IVR 2.0 format that frustrates callers and restricts banks from adequately serving customers. Advancements in Conversational AI in recent times have altered the way industries manage their interactions with customers. Contemporary conversational AI analytics exploiting state-of-the-art machine learning generative AI and natural language processing now possess the capability to provide substantial aid and contextualised personalised encounters. Such encounters lead to heightened levels of satisfaction among bank customers as they rely on tailored solutions. Progress in natural language processing (NLP) has amplified AIs capacity to comprehend interpret and reply to human speech. This evolution enables next-gen conversational AI analytics to not only comprehend customers issues but also grasp intricate contextual nuances. This facilitates tailored responses that cultivate empathy signifying that customer concerns are acknowledged and prioritised. Consequently banks can substantially enhance chatbot experiences fostering a sense of empathy and humanness in automated interactions consequently boosting customer satisfaction and prolonged engagement. Apart from refining chatbot-customer interactions advanced conversational AI analytics can also produce automated summaries of customer dialogues. Banks can mine these summaries for actionable insights into customer requirements and sentiments. This invaluable data can be harnessed by financial institutions or banks to enhance service quality address prevalent issues and fortify customer relationships. Analysing a customers interaction patterns with their bank encompassing service requests unveils significant insights into the customers financial circumstances such as the intention to purchase a home. Recognising these micro-moments empowers banks to offer pertinent products and services adjusted to the customers distinct needs at that precise juncture. AI can streamline this process via intelligent automation. If based on a few interactions a bank identifies a customers readiness for a particular life event it can then devise a tailored set of offerings. Achieving this at scale necessitates conversational AI analytics for enhanced efficiency and engagement rates. Banks and financial institutions may benefit from a wide range of conversational AI technologies that go far beyond simple cost reductions. As the technological landscape continues to evolve as a result of digital breakthroughs and increased competition banks have in Conversational AI analytics the one-of-a-kind opportunity to truly understand the needs sentiments and aspirations of their customers. Conversational AI is the embodiment of empathy and a model of efficiency during customer encounters due to its expertise at decoding complex discussions as well as its ability to provide personalised responses and produce useful summaries. In this age of perpetual change Conversational AI appears not just as a tool but also as a reliable partner in the quest for excellence based on the consumer.

       " 'headline: India can blend the EU and US models of AI regulation  Mint.  content:  During his visit to India Sam Altman once again called for governments worldwide to regulate artificial intelligence (AI). At first glance this proposition may seem paradoxical. Corporations generally prefer a laissez-faire approach from governments favouring minimal regulations that allow businesses maximum freedom. After all more regulation often translates to more bureaucratic oversight increased compliance costs and potential constraints on innovation. Innovators might be discouraged from exploring uncharted territories for fear of non-compliance or burdensome regulatory processes. On the other hand bureaucrats might welcome such advocacy from influential figures in the tech industry like Altman. As Max Weber detailed in Economy and Society: An Outline of Interpretative Sociology bureaucracy at its core seeks to create order uniformity and predictability. A regulated AI landscape may just be the rational systematic environment that traditional bureaucratic systems would be comfortable operating within. As we stand at the frontier of the AI revolution emerging technology ventures including AI grapple with the liability of newness. The hurdles these ventures face are formidablefrom securing necessary resources to stay afloat to establishing their legitimacy among diverse audiences including consumers regulators and government bodies. Carving out a distinctive identity in a convoluted industry structure presents another battlefront. Moreover the ambiguity of the market structure the underdogs fight against large established companies for a voice in policymaking the looming threats of competition from powerful incumbents and resistance from public-policy demanders all combine to create a veritable storm. However Altmans stance which could easily be misunderstood as counter-intuitive may instead be seen as a forward-thinking perspective. The presence of regulation albeit potentially slowing the pace of innovation and erecting higher barriers to entry bestows upon the industry a cloak of legitimacy and quells uncertainties. The powerful and unpredictable societal impact of AI demands greater regulatory involvement. Governance systems must adapt swiftly to the pace of AI development to mitigate unforeseen consequences. There is a growing capacity of AI to manipulate language and influence society from politics to relationships by altering beliefs. Given AIs potential misuse for misinformation and its risk of perpetuating bias effective regulation is crucial. However designing such regulations is a complex and time-consuming task with five inherent challenges. AIs inherently fast-paced and constantly evolving nature often outstrips legislative processes. As such the rapid advancement of technologies particularly those dealing with generative AI systems often leaves regulatory bodies scrambling to catch up. These systems capacity to generate convincing yet fictional texts and images introduces new layers of complexity that make regulation even more challenging. Even defining AI remains an elusive goal. It encompasses a broad spectrum ranging from straightforward automation algorithms to complex machine learning models. The lack of a universally accepted definition complicates efforts to establish clear regulatory parameters thereby hindering the development of precise and relevant regulations. AIs diverse nature defies a blanket regulatory approach risking over-regulation in some areas and under-regulation in others. For instance AI in generative language models needs a different regulatory touch than AI that could imperil infrastructure security or human lives. AI needs an international consensus for effective regulation. However achieving global standardization is no small feat. The varied regulatory approaches and differing stances among countries create a significant barrier to this effort. The EU and the US have contrasting approaches to AI regulation. The EU is proactive aiming to create a strong enduring framework for AI that protects individual rights and data privacy mitigates risks and promotes AI adoption. The EU approach blends specific and general regulations addresses cybersecurity concerns and encourages innovation through regulatory sandboxes. Meanwhile the US favours a decentralized approach assigning responsibilities to specific federal agencies to avoid overregulation and promote innovation. Furthermore we cannot let AI players self-regulate themselves or become pseudo-regulators. A case in point are AI startups involved in creation of deepfakes. AI self-regulation stirs issues of accountability and transparency. Though it may fuel flexibility and innovation its not bulletproof studies reveal it can breed oversight gaps fostering unethical practices or biases. India should consider a balanced approach to AI regulation learning from the EU and US models. Like the EU India needs a robust framework that safeguards individual rights mitigates risks and ensures data protection without impeding AI development. Embracing aspects of the decentralized US model can help avoid overregulation allowing specific sectors to address AI-related issues based on their unique needs and also encourage innovation. ',\n",
       " 'headline: Generative AI and its interplay with law  Mint.  content:  Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has redefined the standards of artificial intelligence revolutionising sectors industries driving innovation and transforming our everyday work and play. Generative AI uses algorithms to produce novel textual audio and visual content by responding to user cues and new audio visual and textual media based on user prompts. While generative AI has tremendous potential in a variety of applications such as video game design marketing campaigns and generation of software codes it is not just limited to creation of unique content. The use of Generative AI in the medical sector is also being explored. The tech can improve accuracy of diagnostic imaging or summarize key data points for medical consultations on the basis of family history and lifestyle. In the legal sector as well Generative AI can help in drafting contract provisions. We can agree to have sheepishly googled to check whether Generative AI is likely to put us out of our jobs Though generative AI or AI broadly delivers human-like intelligence at a significantly reduced cost it has unlocked concerns aroundIP ownership cyber security privacy and is known to perpetuate bias. Since generative AI models rely on existing content on the internet it is likely to inherit stereotypical biases of the internet if left unchecked. For instance Stable diffusion which generates images using AI is known to take racial and social biases to extremes. As per Stable Diffusion women are seldom engineers lawyers or doctors. Dark males are shown as criminals while brown skinned are shown as immigrants. Given that various creative giants are already looking to harness generative AI for content creation callous use of AI is likely to perpetuate bias and stall any growth towards rightful representation. An ongoing battle with generative AI is deepfakes and impersonation attacks. Generative AI makes it possible to initiate phishing scams and hoaxes identity thefts manipulation of elections and financial frauds. You would have heard of calls impersonating a friend in a crisis who wants help only in the form of immediate fund transfer. What is unnerving is that these hoax calls are not just limited to voice calls and include video calls using face-swap technology. Generative AI is also known to be prone to errors when it comes to questions around practical functioning of the world. When generative AI misinterprets a question it makes up an answer with factual errors these are commonly known as hallucinations. As can be understood from the term these erroneous responses are quiet convincing and authentic. For instance there have been instances of generative AI tools generating convincing incorrect responses to medical questions. In another instance it created false stories of sexual harassment against a US professor. All of this raises impending questions around the reliability of Generative AI. Another risk associated with generative AI is the breach of intellectual property rights. Since generative AI relies on volumes of data content generated by AI could be a result of infringed intellectual property of artists. The artist community is increasingly anxious about generative AI like Midjourney and Dall-E which is not only capable of generating high quality images suitable for commercial usage but also mimic the expression and style of the artists. An ongoing debate is whether the current legal framework on intellectual property addresses the concern around AI-generated content both in terms of work being used in AI training as well as the ownership of the AI generated content. Recently in the case of Thaler v. Perlmutter a US district judge upheld the decision of the US Copyright Office to deny copyright application for an art which was generated by AI. The art was autonomously generated by AI and lacked human involvement. The Copyright Office denied the application on the grounds that the work lacked human authorship and reiterated their earlier position of human creativity being an essential part of a valid copyright claim. Earlier also images generated by Midjourney was rejected by the US Copyright Office. The US Copyright Office in a guideline said that copyright protection depends on whether the AIs contributions are the result of mechanical reproduction such as in response to text prompts or if they reflect the authors own mental conception. The office added that The answer will depend on the circumstances particularly how the AI tool operates and how it was used to create the final work. They reiterated that copyright protection also depends on the level of human involvement in creation of the work. There are endless questions arising due to the ambiguity around the copyrightability of AI generated content. The most pertinent question which is being actively debated is who owns the IP for AI- generated output- which leads us to the basic question of whether AI generated content is even qualified as intellectual property Given the growing popularity of generative AI and the increasing number of persons invested in this sector the uncertainties and debate around the copyrightability of AI need to be settled soon. The future likely involves humans and AI working collaboratively with generative AI assisting in tasks that require creativity problem-solving and pattern recognition. While generative AI offers incredible possibilities the associated risks should not be overlooked. Ongoing research and development will drive advancements in generative AI resulting in more sophisticated models improved understanding of human creativity and refined algorithms. Like any other emerging technology the AI space is extremely dynamic and will always be ahead of the existing laws. While countries and organizations are coming up with discussion papers to tackle the issues associated with generative AI and build a regulatory framework the obscurity and inscrutability of AI make it challenging to draft an all encompassing law. Therefore the existing legislations should be modified to build guard rails around the different AI risks. To begin with content generated by AI models should be moderated and a mechanism should be built in to suspend violative/ illegal content. Data for training purposes should be sourced lawfully and safety nets should be built in for publically available sensitive personal information. The regulatory approach should lean towards a trusted and responsible adoption of Generative AI with open consultations with stakeholders which does not hinder innovation.

       " 'headline: AI could unlock growth opportunities for PHL - BusinessWorld Online.  content: By Luisa Maria Jacinta C. Jocson Reporter THE PHILIPPINES should take advantage of the shift to arti fi cial intelligence (AI) technologies which is expected to generate growth opportunities for many industries analysts said. Moodys Investors Service said in a Sept. 6 report that AI and other transformative technologies have the potential to reshape entire industries and drive the emergence of new sectors possibly in content generation mobility education or healthcare fi elds. New technologies it said will boost growth by increasing productivity through task automation process optimization and enhanced decision making. However Moodys also noted that AI may displace industries and workers and may increase inequalities due to the potential demand for high-skilled workers. The Philippines ranked 54 th out of 181 countries in a 2022 Government AI Readiness Index by Oxford Insights. Ria Ysabelle Flora Aboitiz Data Innovation Lead for Power Solutions said increased AI adoption would benefit a number of industries and sectors such as finance in the Philippines. With the help of tech and AI banks that used to work on decades-old systems now are slowly realizing the importance of overcoming their technical debt she said in a Viber message. Ms. Flora said engineering-centric industries such as energy and manufacturing are also seen to gain through business process optimization brought by AI. I see a lot of value potential in AI coming into the energy sector she added. AI is also expected to bring more opportunities for growth in the Information Technology and Business Process Management (IT-BPM) industry. IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) President Jack Madrid said that generative AI (GenAI) holds exciting potential for customer service. Full-scale implementation of GenAI could boost productivity by 50% or even more he said citing studies. In contrast to traditional AI which relies on rule-based systems or standard machine learning algorithms GenAI goes further by understanding context creating coherent and contextually appropriate responses and handling customer inquiries more effectively he said in an e-mail. It can decode complex customer questions discerning nuanced intent sentiment and context leading to accurate and relevant responses. By leveraging customer data GenAI provides personalized answers and suggestions enhancing the customer experience with tailored solutions he added. Mr. Madrid said that GenAI can make the workforce more productive by automating repetitive tasks and allow them to focus on more judgment-sensitive activities. GenAI will create demand for people adept at leveraging AI technologies to drive innovation and growth. As the demand for AI applications and customization grows the need for skilled AI prompt engineers becomes more crucial he added. Mr. Madrid said that it will be crucial for the IT-BPM sector to harness GenAI. By embracing this cutting-edge technology we not only propel our IT-BPM industry to new heights of e ffi ciency and innovation but also fortify the nations position as a beacon of progress in the digital age. OTHER SECTORS AI is seen to boost Philippine growth by 12% in 2030 equivalent to $92 billion according to a report by EDBI and Kearney. Economist Intelligence Unit analyst Laveena Iyer said the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 spurred an intense debate about how AI will a ff ect and bene fi t businesses and consumers. Many companies are already using forms of AI or machine learning for various purposes from automation of manual processes to predicting and ful fi lling customer demand Ms. Iyer said in an e-mail. She said the benefits of leveraging AI would depend on the pace of adoption a countrys digital infrastructure and regulatory framework. The consumer goods sector particularly e-commerce would also gain from AI technologies she added. Ms. Iyer noted that retail companies are using AI for predictive analysis and use geolocation data to re fi ne transparency in their supply chains. In the Philippines online retail sales grew sharply owing to the pandemic and we expect it to account for more than 9% of total retail sales market by 2027 (from less than 3% of the overall market in the pre-pandemic period). We could expect some of the major market players to adopt AI as they go ahead if they havent already she added. Senti AI Founder and Chief Executive O ffi cer Ralph Vincent J. Regalado said that it is inevitable that technologies will change the ways people work regardless of the industry. AI is meant to help people and businesses become more e ffi cient and that should translate to better productivity better output and of course increased returns that will re fl ect on a macroeconomic scale he said in a Viber message. While the Philippines isnt at the forefront of tech adoption Mr. Regalado said the governments push for digital transformation and the private sectors interest in AI solutions is a good sign. Industries that are customer facing he said could also bene fi t from AI solutions like conversational AI or data analytics. The way I see it those that would bene fi t the most from emerging technologies are not sectors but speci fi c organizations that have identified a use case where they can apply these technologies he added. Adopting AI technologies will ultimately lead to adjustment in business operations and the overall economy Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. Chief Economist Michael L. Ricafort said in a Viber message. This would require fine-tuning some functions to adapt to AI a technology that could be further harnessed to further boost e ffi ciency and overall productivity of businesses education and other institutions such as government functions Mr. Ricafort said. RISKS According to Aboitiz Data Innovations Ms. Flora the biggest risk is believing that AI can solve anything. Technology for technologys sake is very dangerous because it retro fi ts solutions to problems that may be deeply entangled with other exogenous factors she said. Ms. Flora said that many fi rms are eager to utilize ChatGPT and other similar technologies to deploy as chatbots hoping these would increase sales. However marketers and executives often forget that these models and technologies would only be e ff ective if the rest of their sales pipeline is e ffi cient and ready to accommodate the possible surge of sales leads she added. For his part IBPAPs Mr. Madrid said the disruption from GenAI should not be underestimated. There is a consensus that it may lead to substantial workforce reductions in certain industries and job roles necessitating large-scale reskilling initiatives to address changing talent needs he said. Mr. Madrid said that studies suggest that graphic designers journalists photographers social media influencers authors educators and linguists may experience signi fi cant changes due to AI. There is also the risk of displacing low-skilled workers and jobs. There could be job displacements especially if its a low-level and repetitive kind of job that can be automated. But again workers at risk of displacement should be upskilled to take on new jobs created due to AI adoption Senti AIs Mr. Regalado said. Workers and businesses would need to adjust to these changes. Some jobs may be considered obsolete if it can be done by AI but those displaced workers should be trained to do new jobs created by the changing business landscape he added. Mr. Madrid said that upskilling the workforce will be key to adapting to new roles and meeting evolving demands. In this new era GenAI will not merely automate tasks but also assist in equipping the workforce with new skills he added. Mr. Regalado said that public and private sectors should ensure that the right policies and regulations are in place to be ready for AI adoption. Do we have enough regulations in place to make sure our data is secure and that AI will be used for good Do we have the infrastructure to support tech adoption Does our workforce have the digital literacy and skill to keep up with the changing demands of the business landscape These are the things we have to fi x if we want the Philippines to reap the full bene fi ts of AI he added. Data privacy is also at risk with the increased use of AI. AI relies heavily on data. A lot of it and most likely very sensitive as well. Organizations have to make sure that they have very secure data storage to avoid any breaches. Another risk is that the models used may exhibit bias if it was not trained properly or if it was not fed the right kind of data Mr. Regalado said. He noted organizations should make sure to do a risk assessment before adopting AI. Terry L. Ridon a public investment analyst and convenor of think tank InfraWatch PH said that AI technology cannot fully replace the high-level analytical and custom work of professionals. While the disruption that may be caused by AI is concerning particularly on the prospect of massive job loss unless it is able to fully replicate the best attributes of employees at all levels of employment the humans are here to stay he said in an e-mail. Mr. Ridon said that AI models can provide big data con fi rmation of professional-created analysis at best but it will still be limited to the breadth of information inputted to the model. Corporates particularly public-facing firms should also determine the role of AI in managing its customer service experience as many consumers will still opt to be able to speak or chat with an actual person to immediately resolve their concerns he said. AI models can also make errors and clients may harbor negative sentiment due to the lack of accountability in the mistakes of AI models Mr. Ridon said. The best attributes (of humans) are not just their capacity to churn out information to end users it includes the ability to process and analyze complex information the ability to take responsibility for all decisions and action and most importantly the ability to empathize with others he added.',\n",
       " 'headline: Five principles for generative AI in financial services - BusinessWorld Online.  content: By Mohan Jayaraman Philipp Rindler Velu Sinha and Maria Teresa Tejada THANKS to recent technological advances in generative arti fi cial intelligence (AI) foundation models and record-breaking rates of consumer adoption its no longer a question whether your company will use this technology. Its a question of when and how. Trained on enormous volumes of data and adapted to many applications foundation models are more sophisticated complex and capable than prior AI tools especially at handling unstructured data. Increasingly offered as a service they are also much easier and economical to adopt. But concerns about unforeseen consequences and potential misuse of the technology make it urgent for business leaders to understand the privacy fairness ethical and social implications of generative AI and to balance those risks against its promising commercial potential. Managing and mitigating the new risks that come with technological advance is familiar terrain for fi nancial service institutions. Generative AI will amplify some well-known concerns but will also present new ones. The risk faced by any individual company will depend on two things: first where and how it applies generative AI and second the maturity of its AI governance. Whatever their level of risk any company using generative AI must identify relevant and emerging risks understand how their applications map to existing and new regulations and enhance internal functions such as machine learning engineering technology and legal in anticipation of new risks. Generative AI has the potential to significantly improve the productivity and quality of many types of knowledge work increase revenue and reduce costs. Consequently financial service organizations are likely to use it in a variety of ways. These may include augmenting the productivity of their workforces personalizing content for consumers and eventually improving consumer self-service. Traditional AI has already been used extensively in financial services typically with structured data for prediction and segmentation. Todays foundation models could be used for converting unstructured data like text images and audio as well as data sets such as communications legal documents and written financial reports into structured data which could then be used for strengthening these existing AI risk models. The breadth and scale of generative AIs likely uses combined with its evolving social and ethical risks make creating and managing a comprehensive governance program complex ( see Figure 1 ). REGULATORY RISKS Regulators are clearly still catching up to the rapid evolution of generative AI and foundation models. In the coming months executives will have to watch out for upcoming regulations and proactively manage them. These will come from existing regulatory bodies that are forming their perspectives as well as from new regulatory entities that may be created specifically for this technology such as those envisioned in the European Unions AI Act. Generative AI also exposes organizations to increased legal risk from inadvertent or unintentional exposure of customer data by employees experimenting on public or shared systems uncertainties in the provenance of data used in training foundation models and potential copyright risks on content generated using these technologies. Additionally the economic risks from regulatory noncompliance must also be considered  the draft European regulations are suggesting stiff financial penalties similar to fines for noncompliance with data privacy regulations. OPERATIONAL RISKS Given the rapid pace of advances in generative AI many features and capabilities are being launched to support experimentation. Until these solutions are hardened to support scaling control privacy monitor performance manage security anomalies follow data sovereignty access regulations and meet enterprise service levels their commercial use must be very carefully considered. Excessive complexity can make these systems brittle and more vulnerable to new vectors of cybersecurity attack like training data poisoning and prompt injection attacks. It is likely too that the technologys ease of use may enable generation of malicious e-mails phishing attacks and deepfakes of voices and images among other issues. Vendor risk relates both to locking into a walled garden especially as the vendor ecosystem grows and to the possibility that some vendors will not survive in this increasingly busy space. Open-source models may have their own complexity of maintenance and upgrades. MODEL RISKS The fi nancial service industry has well-developed policies of fairness accuracy explainability and transparency built in compliance with regulatory guidelines. Generative AI intensi fi es some existing risks associated with AI while requiring a di ff erent approach to others. Given the large amount of data that goes into creating foundation models for example it is likely that bias will creep into some aspects of the data. And with foundation models mostly available as a service new and derivative applications will inherit their risk of bias. Earlier machine learning models produced structured output for specific tasks while generative AI creates novel results whose fi delity and accuracy can be di ffi cult to assess. One particular concern: It can hallucinate output that was not present in its training data. Thats a desirable result when looking for innovative content but unacceptable if presented without verification or qualification. ECONOMIC RISKS As with any new technology unless planned correctly generative AI initiatives run the risk of becoming expensive experiments that dont deliver shareholder value. There is a risk of underestimating the extent to which an organization and its people will need to transform in order to realize the bene fi ts of generative AI. Given the technologys evolving nature companies risk investing in the wrong technology or failing to hit the right balance between what they choose to build in-house and what they buy from outside vendors. Ultimately every executive worries they might lose out to a competitor that deploys the technology in a way that is so appealing to customers it renders their business model obsolete. REPUTATION RISKS The tectonic shift generative AI is precipitating brings fear of automation and the potential impact on employment employees and society at large. Stakeholders including customers employees and investors have all demonstrated as they have with ESG (environmental social and governance) that they place a high level of emphasis on social responsibility and this technology will be no exception. 5 DESIGN PRINCIPLES Building the organizational capability to responsibly design and deploy generative AI will require an investment of significant resources. By focusing that invest ment on five principles compa nies can begin to mitigate risk and achieve their responsible AI goals while delivering on their strategic ambitions ( see Figure 2 ). 1. Be human-centric  design for transparency and explainability. Generative AI systems must be built with audit trails and monitoring that fit their end use. This will help ensure that the systems are accessible and fair are not unfairly biased and do not discriminate. All stakeholders should be adequately informed when they interact with a machine and should be able to reach a human to escalate any issues they have with a decision made by the system. For AI to be trustworthy it must be designed for human agency and oversight. It is critical that fi nancial service institutions ensure that a human is in the generative AI loop whether to review feedback or address an escalated problem. End-users or other subjects should always know when a decision content advice or outcome is the result of an algorithm. 2. Know where you stand ensure that data privacy and infrastructure are robust. With a growing choice of foundation models and providers organizations will need to select the right service and vendor. Some companies will choose a fully cloud-hosted software-as-a-service approach while others will opt for models with privately managed infrastructure. As with other cloud technologies companies will need to balance the simplicity of single sourcing against the risk of becoming locked into one vendor and be aware of their vendors data security privacy and data residency standards. Whichever choice is made companies can build their technical infrastructure to be foundation-model agnostic so that they have the fl exibility to change with the evolution of the ecosystem. Financial service firms can specifically mitigate customer and organizational data privacy concerns as well as security and performance risks by opting for the right technology architecture and focusing on building capability in prompt engineering embeddings and outputs. 3. Earn trust  prepare for regulation. Regulators are playing catch-up on generative AI but organizations can prepare by proactively monitoring for evaluating and addressing risks and taking a forward-looking approach to governance risk management and compliance reporting. 4. Employ agility  ensure oversight and disclosure before and after deployment. Given the fast-evolving nature of this technology and its scale companies will have to keep monitoring their applications for new and developing risks after deployment and build a human override. They must also have explicit criteria for testing and evaluating the model. Tools that provide information about the AI such as model cards will need to evolve to ensure that foundation models can be quantitatively evaluated and tested at industrial scale before deployment. 5. Act with intention  consider organizational maturity and AI governance when selecting applications. When companies first develop generative AI it makes sense to focus on uses with low risk. Later as their responsible AI capabilities mature companies can work up to those with higher risk. It may be ideal for organizations to start with internal applications then move on to applications with a limited set of external users. Once those applications have built detailed feedback loops they can expand to a wider audience. Generative AI is no longer futuristic but an imminent reality one o ff ering fi nancial service leaders both unparalleled opportunities and new business and societal risks. Financial service firms can responsibly embrace this transformative technology by building robust governance frameworks and upskilling and reskilling employees to adapt to the AI-driven workplace. This starts with a conscious decision to prioritize responsible AI practices that are designed with their broader impact in mind and aligned with the organizations core values and long-term strategic objectives. By pioneering an appropriate model for deploying generative AI financial service organizations have the opportunity to not only gain competitive advantage in an increasingly digital world but also set an example of responsibility and foresight.

       " 'headline: ChatGPT: A versatile AI model - BusinessWorld Online.  content: Suits The C -Suite By Randall C. Antonio (First of two parts) In November ChatGPT 3.5 was released  and took the world by storm. ChatGPT touted its ability to create essays write computer code pass board exams create business plans and many other tasks such as but not limited to analyzing professional contracts and complex spreadsheets. The ChatGPT 3.5 architecture follows ChatGPT 3 which was launched in 2020 and is now being used by many large organizations such as Microsoft Corp. Google LLC and Amazon.com Inc. for chatbots virtual assistants and other AI-powered applications. ChatGPT or the Chat-Generative Pre-Trained Transformer algorithm was developed by OpenAI. OpenAI is an artificial intelligence (AI) research laboratory based in the US established in late 2015. It aims to promote and develop friendly AI running on the fifth most powerful supercomputer in the world. Close to six months after the launch of ChatGPT 3.5 OpenAI also launched ChatGPT 4. It promises to be even more powerful and versatile than its predecessor improving on the weaknesses and limitations of ChatGPT 3 (which uses a relatively small database to train on). ChatGPT 4 uses a much larger 50 terabytes of high-quality training data through a combination of automatic and manual curation methods. This allows ChatGPT 4 to deliver better conversational AI applications understand context and generate more natural-sounding text. It is powerful enough to detect and respond to changes in tone and sentiment and unlike ChatGPT 3 can also make images. THE SCIENCE BEHIND GPT Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) is a type of large language model (LLM) neural network that can perform various and complex natural language processing tasks. It is a type of a deep learning algorithm that uses a transformer network (a sequence to sequence translator architecture used for language models and computer vision) specifically developed to train from large quantities of unlabeled text using unsupervised learning analyzing patterns in the data set to generate human-like text in response to input. LLMs need access to large datasets of text called training data. Such data come from a variety of sources including books articles websites academic papers social media posts blogs news articles and other online and offline text sources  without any explicit supervision or guidance on what to learn except to automatically discover patterns and relationships in the data and use them. ChatGPT uses this data to generate more natural-sounding text. THE HUMAN ASPECT While there are many positive opportunities presented by ChatGPT ongoing debates in the tech community center on the threats posed by the larger AI. ChatGPT is indeed revolutionary but it also gave us a taste of the real risks and dangers. Some of these hot topics relating to the human aspect include social manipulation job losses social surveillance gender and race biases socio-economic inequality weakening ethics and goodwill financial crises and a dangerous arms race of AI-powered weaponry. RESPONSE BIASES ChatGPT responses can be categorized into those that are mathematically or scientifically accurate i.e. the answer to 1  1 or that water is liquid at room temperature. The other category consists of subjective responses i.e. whether red is a better color than maroon or whether certain politicians are performing better than their predecessors. It is worth noting that there have been concerns about the potential biases in the training data sets used for language models like ChatGPT. Biases in the data can lead to biased outputs which could have negative consequences in real-world applications. ChatGPT just like humans can still provide subjective inaccurate or wrong answers that are biased. When these biases cross ethical boundaries because of the quality and manual curation of the training data this means that such biases can sometimes cause more societal harm than good. BUSINESS APPLICATIONS Rest assured ChatGPT (and AI) will be here to stay continuing to evolve and advance at lightspeed. It will continue to highlight that the world we live in will be significantly different as early as next year. Many businesses are scrambling to understand both the implications and opportunities provided by ChatGPT to their organizations. ChatGPT as applied in business could in a lot of ways improve the bottom line enhance efficiency and transform customer experience while reducing costs. Some use case examples for ChatGPT are chatbots content creation code development fraud and abnormality detection language translation voice assistants and hyper-personalization for recommendation engines. There are also potentially vast opportunities along with accompanying risks in sectors such as education creative services professional services content creation and many others. Many more technically adept companies are already finding amazing use cases of ChatGPT and AI that end up disrupting traditional businesses. TRANSFORMING THE FUTURE THROUGH AI There is no doubt that ChatGPT is still in its infancy stage which simply means that there is much more to expect. Our lives will change and the rapid rate of this change will be like no other compared to all human history. Just like electricity and water ChatGPT is also expected to become a mainstream utility. It will be much faster cheaper more accurate and eventually some even say it will be sentient. It will become a necessary and unavoidable part of our daily lives. According to a report from Opus Research 35% of consumers would like to see more enterprises incorporate AI tools like chatbots whereas 48% of them are indifferent as to whether an AI or a human were to assist them. While not the majority a considerable percentage of people are seeing the benefits of AI. As this technology only continues to get better many jobs and traditional businesses will need to transform or be at risk of being displaced. Industries and processes will be disrupted and new opportunities and applications will surface. The only question will be: are we ready for it In the second part of this article we discuss the practical ways ChatGPT can be used in business and the potential risks it presents. This article is for general information only and is not a substitute for professional advice where the facts and circumstances warrant.

       " 'headline: ChatGPT: A versatile AI model - BusinessWorld Online.  content: Suits The C -Suite By Randall C. Antonio (Second of two parts) W hen ChatGPT 3.5 was released last year it made global headlines for its ability to perform tasks such as analyzing professional contracts and complex spreadsheets. ChatGPT is a rapidly evolving text-based artificial intelligence (AI) that facilitates human interactions via its natural language responses. Despite its nascency ChatGPT has already solidified its presence in various industries. Its myriad of functions (e.g. content creation data analysis and code generation) can help organizations enhance their products and services streamline work processes and refine customer service. However many are also deeply concerned about its use in business education and various other sectors. In the first part of this article we discussed the science behind Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) hot topics regarding its human aspect its response biases and potential business applications. In this second part we discuss the practical ways ChatGPT can be used in business and the potential risks it presents. PRACTICAL BUSINESS USE CASES With the ability of AI to automate several tasks businesses can reduce their labor costs while simultaneously enhancing workflows. ChatGPTs flexibility can support and possibly even enhance various corporate functions such as customer service data analytics sales and marketing and finance. Customer service. Given its text-based nature ChatGPT can leverage its ability to customize responses based on user prompts to facilitate a seamless user experience. The programs versatility means that it can be incorporated into different platforms such as chatbots e-mail and SMS. ChatGPT can provide round-the-clock support potentially becoming instrumental in the banking healthcare and information technology (IT) industries. Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can capitalize on AI by setting up a chatbot that can interface with customers without needing human moderation. Since the AI will continue to evolve through repeated customer interactions the company can make use of the data for continuous improvement. Data analysis. ChatGPT has a wealth of information to draw on potentially making it an asset for tasks such as market research research and development and financial forecasts. Businesses will be able to analyze data more efficiently given its comprehensive set of information. A practical example would be ChatGPTs capacity to break down complex code and generate bug fixes. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing are corporate functions that require a more personalized approach and ChatGPT can address this by utilizing its natural language model to create bespoke solutions. Apart from generating SEO-friendly keywords to outlining drafts ChatGPT can also produce personalized e-mails blogs and video ideas. BUSINESS RISKS Despite ChatGPTs potential for streamlining operations it can pose risks for organizations. Given the nature of this AI and how it can evolve (i.e. it analyzes large data sets on the internet before generating a response based on the user prompt) security accuracy and fairness are paramount concerns. A potential pitfall for the AI lies in its primary competency  that it can facilitate more human-like interactions since humans are prone to error and subject to different biases. Its very strength can prove to be its weakness since the conveniences it affords can also facilitate the spread of disinformation ethical issues and copyright disputes. Data accuracy. OpenAI the company behind the program acknowledged that the software produced erroneous and/or biased content. One of the programs limitations is that its learning model was programmed in 2021 which means that it has little-to-no knowledge of developments since then. It is also worth mentioning that not all online information is accurate proving to be a substantial constraint for ChatGPT. People have even claimed that the AI can hallucinate because it has populated user queries with false information such as listing down incorrect credentials for public individuals. Cybersecurity and data privacy. Its online nature makes ChatGPT vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks that make it a potential risk to businesses. The program can endanger ones privacy because it can sift through a vast range of data accessible online. Businesses will have to deliberate whether the technologys benefits outweigh its potential security risks. They must also be vigilant when it comes to the security of both themselves as well as their clients. Bias. In the first part of the article we discussed how ChatGPT has a category of answers that consists of subjective responses. This inherent bias may deter corporations from assimilating it into their established work systems. There was a case wherein ChatGPT was asked which airline passengers could pose a risk and it asserted that individuals who traveled to North Korea Afghanistan Iraq and Syria were the more prominent dangers. The learning model is continuously evolving but it still needs some form of arbitration to avoid ethics and bias-related issues. Ethics. In academia there have been longstanding divergent opinions when it comes to technological advancements ranging from the archaic decision of whether smartphones should be allowed in class to more current concerns such as the ethics of using AI to accomplish assignments and/or examinations. The jury is still out as institutions have varied responses with some universities mandating the return of in-person exams to safeguard against cheating whereas others have started to delineate AI-specific guidelines. Plagiarism however remains a principal concern. The convenience of AI may exacerbate issues when it comes to the originality of work whether in academia or corporations. Intellectual property and copyright. In light of ongoing discussions that ChatGPT can replace or at the very least assist with certain types of work it is vital to understand the legal repercussions. With copyright protection the US Copyright Office will not register work that was generated by an AI. In accordance with US law AI-generated output will either be a claimless work available in the public domain or considered a derivative work of the tools that the AI was developed upon. This raises the question as to who the true owner is  the creators of ChatGPT or the user for whom the output was generated. AI IS HERE TO STAY As one of many developing AIs ChatGPT offers advantages and risks for personal users and organizations. It is also apparent that human intervention is necessary to truly leverage its benefits and mitigate its intrinsic shortcomings. With the current technological climate though it seems that businesses will no longer be able to turn a blind eye to the program. Similarly OpenAI is not the only company making headlines when it comes to artificial intelligence as other companies are racing to develop their own versions. One thing is clear  AI is here to stay . Technology is at the forefront of business change and learning how to leverage it is critical. ChatGPT has jolted the corporate landscape presenting both challenges and opportunities for organizations. For companies considering the use of AI it is vital to evaluate its role in their respective ecosystems. Ultimately the biggest question is whether hypothetical returns will be enough to mitigate the potential risks.

       " 'headline: ChatGPT and AI are the next worker recruitment and retention game changers.  content: For many companies jumping into the world of rapidly evolving technology like chatbots and generative artificial intelligence can be scary. Even so OpenAIs ChatGPT  Microsoft s Bing AI and Google s Bard are all in the spotlight as companies invest in these large language models and the technology behind its human-like conversations. In the world of HR and talent acquisition ChatGPT and AI have the potential to reinvigorate the entire recruitment and retention experience for both candidates and employees said Sultan Saidov co-founder and president of Beamery a global human capital management SaaS firm which has its own AI language model platform called TalentGPT. Historically HR has been built around processes rather than around people he said. The first question we should ask ourselves when it comes to adopting AI and GPT technology is What does it take for companies to treat people like they treat their customers Whether its a candidate employee or manager our experiences as consumers over the last decade with or without AI have become increasingly frictionless and personalized he added. As a result companies need to move away from process-oriented systems and experiences and instead use AI to create more personal experiences for candidates employees and any stakeholder within the company. Candidates prefer a personable recruitment experience Even with layoffs sweeping the labor market companies continue to struggle with HR issues like return-to-office mandates  lower productivity  disengagement  and retention . Saidov suggests using AI and chatbots to help mitigate these issues by incorporating them at the beginning of the employee journey: job applications and recruitment. From screening resumes scheduling candidate interviews and supporting onboarding AI can help at each stage of the candidate experience says Sameer Penakalapati CEO at Ceipal an AI-driven talent acquisition platform. From the beginning AI can screen and rank candidates by categorizing them into a ranking system for recruiters and then chatbots can communicate with candidates through messaging about standard topics like compensation expectations Penakalapati said. This creates an experience for candidates thats smooth he added. At the same time recruiters and HR teams collect the information they need before connecting a candidate to a member of their team. Speed and efficiency are integral to creating a more personal candidate experience Penakalapati said and AI and ChatGPT technology can help recruiters achieve this. Screening candidates is the biggest component of finding talent and recruiters hiring managers and HR leaders only have limited time to fill positions for their organizations Penakalapati said. Chatbots can dramatically cut down the amount of time it takes to review resumes and identify candidates that are ready to move onto the next stage of the job interview. With the incorporation of these tools a candidate can apply to a job and instantly get screened for a position and the first conversation between a candidate and recruiter can be focused on personality and fit with a companys culture Penakalapati said. Workers will stay at companies with employee-focused experiences Whether it results in falling productivity or quiet quitting employees point back to their companys internal and sometimes outdated processes as a contributor for leaving or not staying engaged. Some experts already see VR and AI as game changers for these issues. Saidov said companies need to invest in their employees experiences the same way they invest in their customers. He likens the situation to the way consumers use Google Maps explaining that It tells you exactly how you get from here to there for a certain destination. For an employee trying to navigate choices in their company nothing like that exists. AI and chatbots could enable workers to see not only how their role fits in the bigger picture of the company but also explore the exact pathways they can navigate to move up in their career or move laterally into a new role making them less likely to quit Saidov said. An employee working in marketing for instance would be able to ask a chatbot how they could become a product manager complete with details on how others in the company made that career transition. AI would also enable that employee to learn what skills or education is needed for a different role. AI helps create this experience by helping workers access information about what is happening in the company in a very natural way Saidov said. It helps them see their future at a company and analyze the trajectories of people who started in similar roles as them. AI can help increase diversity and inclusion Deploying AI and ChatGPT can potentially help HR executives navigate diversity and inclusion challenges. Research shows growing unhappiness among workers with Black workers among the most unhappy employees . Issues with pay transparency a misalignment of personal values with company values and a desire for more diverse leadership are the major reasons why Black employees are unsatisfied. The transparency that AI can provide in assisting with choices in the employee experience creates more than just a nicer experience Saidov said. It provides an opportunity to create more inclusion. AI and chatbots can help increase inclusion by generating career pathways and matching candidates to jobs that are skills-centric versus education-centric. It can be a guide for disadvantaged workers in a company to level up their proficiency by giving them an opportunity to re-skill or upskill. These platforms create more inclusion by creating better transparency and by giving employees more choices to make real career improvements he adds. watch now VIDEO 3:39 03:39 ChatGPT: How Salesforce is using generative A.I.

       " 'headline: Godfather of A.I. leaves Google after a decade to warn society of technology hes touted.  content: Geoffrey Hinton known as The Godfather of AI received his Ph.D. in artificial intelligence 45 years ago and has remained one of the most respected voices in the field. For the past decade Hinton worked part-time at Google  between the companys Silicon Valley headquarters and Toronto. But he has quit the internet giant and he told The New York Times that hell be warning the world about the potential threat of AI which he said is coming sooner than he previously thought. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away Hinton told the Times in a story published Monday. Obviously I no longer think that. Hinton who was named a 2018 Turing Award winner for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs said he now has some regrets over his lifes work the Times reported. He cited the near-term risks of AI taking jobs and the proliferation of fake photos videos and text that appear real to the average person. In a statement to CNBC Hinton said I now think the digital intelligences we are creating are very different from biological intelligences. Hinton referenced the power of GPT-4 the most-advanced large language model or LLM from startup OpenAI whose technology has gone viral since the chatbot ChatGPT was launched late last year. Heres how he described whats happening now: If I have 1000 digital agents who are all exact clones with identical weights whenever one agent learns how to do something all of them immediately know it because they share weights Hinton told CNBC.  Biological agents cannot do this. So collections of identical digital agents can acquire hugely more knowledge than any individual biological agent. That is why GPT-4 knows hugely more than any one person. watch now VIDEO 1:57 01:57 Bill Gates calls OpenAIs GPT the most important tech advance since 1980 Squawk on the Street Hinton was sounding the alarm even before leaving Google. In an interview with CBS News that aired in March Hinton was asked what he thinks the chances are of AI just wiping out humanity. He responded Its not inconceivable. Thats all Ill say. Google CEO Sundar Pichai has also publicly warned of the risks of AI. He told 60 Minutes last month that society isnt prepared for whats coming. At the same time Google is showing off its own products such as self-learning robots and Bard its ChatGPT competitor. But when asked if the pace of change can outstrip our ability to adapt Pichai downplayed the risk. I dont think so. Were sort of an infinitely adaptable species he said. Over the past year Hinton has reduced his time at Google according to an internal document viewed by CNBC. In March 2022 he moved to 20% of full-time. Later in the year he was assigned to a new team within Brain Research. His most recent role was vice president and engineering fellow reporting to Jeff Dean within Google Brain. In an emailed statement to CNBC Dean said he appreciated Hinton for his decade of contributions at Google. Ill miss him and I wish him well Dean wrote. As one of the first companies to publish AI Principles  we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. Were continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly. Hintons departure is a high-profile loss for Google Brain the team behind much of the companys work in AI. Several years ago Google reportedly spent $44 million to acquire a company started by Hinton and two of his students in 2012. His research group made major breakthroughs in deep learning that accelerated speech recognition and object classification. Their technology would help form new ways of using AI including ChatGPT and Bard. Google has rallied teams across the company to integrate Bards technology and LLMs into more products and services. Last month the company said it would be merging Brain with DeepMind to significantly accelerate our progress in AI. According to the Times Hinton said he quit his job at Google so he could freely speak out about the risks of AI. He told the paper I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadnt done it somebody else would have. Hinton tweeted on Monday I left so that I could talk about the dangers of AI without considering how this impacts Google. Google has acted very responsibly.',\n",
       " 'headline: These are the tech jobs most threatened by ChatGPT and A.I..  content: As if there werent already enough layoff fears in the tech industry add ChatGPT to the list of things workers are worrying about reflecting the advancement of this artificial intelligence-based chatbot trickling its way into the workplace. So far this year the tech industry already has cut 5% more jobs than it did in all of 2022 according to Challenger Gray  Christmas. The rate of layoffs is on track to pass the job loss numbers of 2001 the worst year for tech layoffs due to the dot-com bust. As layoffs continue to mount workers are not only scared of being laid off theyre scared of being replaced all together. A recent Goldman Sachs report found 300 million jobs around the world stand to be impacted by AI and automation. But ChatGPT and AI shouldnt ignite fear among employees because these tools will help people and companies work more efficiently according to Sultan Saidov co-founder and president of Beamery a global human capital management software-as-a-service company which has its own GPT or generative pretrained transformer called TalentGPT. Its already being estimated that 300 million jobs are going to be impacted by AI and automation Saidov said. The question is: Does that mean that those people will change jobs or lose their jobs I think in many cases its going to be changed rather than lose. ChatGPT is one type of GPT tool that uses learning models to generate human-like responses and Saidov says GPT technology can help workers do more than just have conversations. Especially in the tech industry specific jobs stand to be impacted more than others. Creatives and designers should adopt AI skills Saidov points to creatives in the tech industry like designers video game creators photographers and those who create digital images as those whose jobs will likely not be completely eradicated. It will help these roles create more and do their jobs quicker he said. If you look back to the industrial revolution when you suddenly had automation in farming did it mean fewer people were going to be doing certain jobs in farming Saidov said. Definitely because youre not going to need as many people in that area but it just means the same number of people are going to different jobs. Just like similar trends in history creative jobs will be in demand after the widespread inclusion of generative AI and other AI tech in the workplace. With video game creators if the number of games made globally doesnt change year over year youll probably need fewer game designers Saidov said. But if you can create more as a company then this technology will just increase the number of games youll be able to get made. Software developers and engineers will be impacted Due to ChatGPT buzz many software developers and engineers are apprehensive about their job security causing some to seek new skills and learn how to engineer generative AI and add these skills to their resume . Its unfair to say that GPT will completely eliminate jobs like developers and engineers says Sameer Penakalapati chief executive officer at Ceipal an AI-driven talent acquisition platform. But even though these jobs will still exist their tasks and responsibilities could likely be diminished by GPT and generative AI. Theres an important distinction to be made between GPT specifically and generative AI more broadly when it comes to the job market according to Penakalapati. GPT is a mathematical or statistical model designed to learn patterns and provide outcomes. But other forms of generative AI can go further reconstructing different outcomes based on patterns and learnings and almost mirroring a human brain he said. As an example Penakalapati says if you look at software developers engineers and testers GPT can generate code in a matter of seconds giving software users and customers exactly what they need without the back and forth of relaying needs adaptations and fixes to the development team. GPT can do the job of a coder or tester instantly rather than the days or weeks it may take a human to generate the same thing he said. Generative AI can more broadly impact software engineers and specifically devops (development and operations) engineers Penakalapati said from the development of code to deployment conducting maintenance and making updates in software development. In this broader set of tasks generative AI can mimic what an engineer would do through the development cycle. While development and engineering roles are quickly adapting to these tools in the workplace Penakalapati said itll be impossible for the tools to totally replace humans. More likely well see a decrease in the number of developers and engineers needed to create a piece of software. watch now VIDEO 8:16 08:16 Can Chinas ChatGPT clones give it an edge over the U.S. in an A.I. arms race International Digital Originals Whether its a piece of code youre writing whether youre testing how users interact with your software or whether youre designing software and choosing certain colors from a color palette youll always need somebody a human to help in the process Penakalapati said. Knowledge workers could benefit from ChatGPT While GPT and AI will heavily impact more roles than others the incorporation of these tools will impact every knowledge worker commonly referred to as anyone who uses or handles information in their job according to Michael Chui a partner at the McKinsey Global Institute. These technologies enable the ability to create first drafts very quickly of all kinds of different things whether its writing generating computer code creating images video and music Chui said. You can imagine almost any knowledge worker being able to benefit from this technology and certainly the technology provides speed with these types of capabilities. A recent study by OpenAI  the creator of ChatGPT found that roughly 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of learning models in GPT tech while roughly 19% of workers might see 50% of their tasks impacted. Chui said workers today cant remember a time when they didnt have tools like Microsoft Excel or Microsoft Word so in some ways we can predict that workers in the future wont be able to imagine a world of work without AI and GPT tools. Even technologies that greatly increased productivity in the past didnt necessarily lead to having fewer people doing work Chui said. Bottom line is the world will always need more software. watch now VIDEO 2:50 02:50 Warren Buffett on ChatGPT and AI: This is extraordinary but not sure if its beneficial yet Squawk Box',\n",
       " 'headline: AI is the latest buzzword in techbut before investing know these 4 terms.  content: ChatGPT  the viral chatbot that generates conversational responses to written inputs from users has made artificial intelligence (AI) the latest buzzword in tech. AI took center stage at Googles annual developers conference on May 10 where the company announced that its search engine would incorporate AI in order to synthesize search results for users. The company also plans to integrate AI into Gmail to help users write emails. Following its $13 billion investment into OpenAI the creator of ChatGPT Microsoft announced its Bing search engine would use AI to deliver better search more complete answers a new chat experience. The company has also infused its popular Microsoft 365 apps including Word and Excel with a new set of AI features dubbed Copilot. And many companies are already integrating AI with their own products. In fact 94% of business leaders agree that AI will be critical to the success of their companies over the next five years according to Deloittes latest State of AI in the Enterprise survey. On the investment side Goldman Sachs is optimistic about the future of AI and believes the technology could fuel a rise in productivity and drive up SP 500 profits by 30% or more in the next decade Goldmans senior strategist Ben Snider told CNBC in May . But despite the hype if youre interested in investing in AI or anything AI-adjacent its important to understand what youre putting your money in before parting ways with any cash. Here are four AI terms to know. 1. Machine learning Although machine learning may sound new the term was actually coined by AI pioneer Arthur Samuel in 1959. Samuel defined it as a computers ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. To do that mathematical models or algorithms are fed large data sets and trained to identify patterns within each set. In theory the algorithms are then able to apply the same pattern recognition process to a new data set. For example Spotify uses machine learning to analyze the music you listen to and recommend similar artists or generate playlists. 2. Large language model A large language model (LLM) is an algorithm that learns how to recognize summarize and generate text and other types of content after processing huge sets of data according to Nvidia . These models are trained using unsupervised learning which means the algorithm is given a data set but isnt programmed on what to do with it. Through this process an LLM learns how to determine the relationship between words and the concepts behind them. 3. Generative AI Large language models are a type of generative AI. As its name implies generative AI refers to artificial intelligence that is capable of generating content such as text video or audio according to Googles AI blog . In order to accomplish this generative AI models use machine learning to process massive data sets and respond to a users input with new content according to Nvidia . 4. GPT ChatGPT is another example of a generative AI tool. The GPT stands for generative pretrained transformers. GPT is OpenAIs large language model and is what powers the chatbot helping it to produce human-like responses . However OpenAI says that ChatGPT sometimes may write plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers according to its website . People have been using ChatGPT for a variety of tasks including writing emails and planning vacations . The popular chatbot amassed 100 million monthly active users just two months into its launch making it the fastest growing consumer application in history according to a UBS note published in January.

       " 'headline: Senators to introduce a bipartisan AI bill aimed at keeping up with China.  content: WASHINGTON  A bipartisan group of senators will introduce legislation on Thursday aimed at managing the rise of artificial intelligence and its use by U.S. adversaries. The new bill comes as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. has vowed to make addressing AI a priority and members of both parties are eyeing Big Tech  and AI in particular  as key focuses for this Congress. The Global Technology Leadership Act would establish an office that analyzes how competitive the country is in critical technologies like AI in comparison to rivals such as China according to bill text shared exclusively with NBC News. The federal entity  named the Office of Global Competition Analysis  would consist of experts from the intelligence community the Pentagon and other relevant agencies that use both intel and private-sector commercial data to make these assessments. A summary of the legislation notes that although the Department of Defense evaluates how our battleships tanks and aircraft compare to other nations there is no equivalent process for critical technologies like AI. The legislations authors argue that creating the office would bolster American competitiveness inform policymakers and strengthen U.S. leadership in strategic innovation. There is nobody  and I say this with complete certainty  no one in the federal government who can tell us how  nor frankly in the United States of America really  who can tell us how the U.S. stacks up in comparison to China in critical technologies like AI Sen. Michael Bennet D-Colo. told NBC News in an interview. The point of all this is to make sure that we can evaluate our technology leadership relative to other countries and inform the appropriate policy response so we dont get caught by surprise again as we did with 5G he added. Bennet is leading the bill with bipartisan co-sponsors Sens. Todd Young R-Ind. and Mark Warner D-Va. The new legislation falls under the Senate Intelligence Committees jurisdiction which Warner chairs and its introduction comes as Schumer has publicly declared that preparing for a future defined by AI and outcompeting the Chinese government are two of his top priorities this year. Schumer on Tuesday sent a Dear Colleague letter with Young along with Sens. Mike Rounds R-S.D. and Martin Heinrich D-N.M outlining three senators-only AI briefings that will take place over the course of the summer. The last one which focuses on adversaries use of AI will be the first-ever classified all-senators briefing on AI Schumer said. I urge all my colleagues to attend these briefings because it wont be long before we see AIs dramatic changes in the workplace in the classroom in our living rooms and in virtually every corner of our lives the leader said on the Senate floor this week. Its already starting to happen. We must be ready. More from NBC News: States have introduced nearly 200 bills this year to subvert elections report finds Satellite images show the scale of the Ukraine dam destruction Air quality concerns continue into Thursday as wildfire smoke covers the Northeast Members of the upper chamber have stressed that Schumer is keenly interested in AI and the leader himself told reporters in April that he discussed the topic during a meeting with Elon Musk on Capitol Hill. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman whose company developed ChatGPT has also met with members of Congress and testified last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Bennet told NBC News that his staff has discussed his Global Technology Leadership Act with Schumers team and the Colorado Democrat believes his bill has a real chance. I am really enthusiastic about his effort to legislate around our competition with China this year Bennet said of Schumer. Thats distinct but related to the work that hes doing in a bipartisan way to educate the caucus on AI. And so I think all these things fit well together and I would expect and hope that if we move legislation along the lines that Sen. Schumer has suggested that this would be a fundamental part of what were trying to do. Schumer has also met with Rounds Young and Heinrich in the past about their emerging bipartisan group focused on comprehensive AI legislation according to a source familiar with the meeting. Bennet noted that both AI and competition with China are issues ripe for bipartisan support. Asked to predict the odds of his legislation becoming law Bennet responded I think theres a high likelihood of success.',\n",

       " 'headline: There is only one way to overcome workers fear of AI says PwCs Tim Ryan.  content: As companies look to deploy generative artificial intelligence across their businesses leaders run the risk of leaving the bulk of their employees behind. Thats a mistake that will cost companies dearly according to PwCs Tim Ryan. Since generative AI burst onto the business landscape last November CEOs  have been trying to understand the impact the technology will have on their companies. Breathless interviews about generative AIs ability to do everything from supply chain management to customer service better faster and with fewer humans in the mix have dominated the headlines. Meanwhile workers still trying to recalibrate after the pandemic and the massive layoffs that occurred last year thanks to sky-high inflation and an uncertain economy are wondering if AI will permanently erase their jobs. Ryan said hes seen this cycle before. When he took over the top spot at PwC in 2016 the firm was in the midst of its own aggressive tech transformation. Workers he said were worried their jobs were going away as a result. He knew the only way to quell that worry was to train them on the new technologies PwC was using. We taught our people how to use data analytics bots how to use visualization and we had massive success he said. We made a commitment to our people not to leave them behind as long as they chose not to be left behind. Upskilling was very important because we were sensitive to what our people were feeling and that was worry. AI as a job creator not job eliminator Ryan said he sees that same job loss worry bubbling up again but this time more intensely since AI is dominating the conversation. However hes not in the camp that foresees the elimination of large parts of the workforce. I dont think AI is a mass job eliminator. An aging population economic growth coming from overhauls to healthcare and infrastructure and more nearshoring to eliminate supply chain risk are just some of the reasons why he believes the AI-as-job-eliminator narrative is false. AI is going to be an evolution not a revolution he said. To think were going to wake up tomorrow and find an entire part of the workforce wiped out is a bit nave. Instead what Ryan is seeing within PwC and with the companys clients is a shift in what employees should do and what can be better done by AI. Inside PwC for example AI is enabling auditors to speed through 150- to 200-page 10-K financial documents in a fraction of the time it took them before. Looking for trends and anomalies in these filings is what auditors do all day long Ryan said. Through PwCs partnership with Microsoft the company built its own version of ChatGPT. This private platform enables PwC auditors to look at multiple companies in different sectors to unearth trends and analyze data. The company said its part of a $1 billion investment over the next three years to expand its AI offerings. The auditors jobs didnt go away just the less exciting part of hunting down data he said. The part of the job that brings out the true value of the auditors  analyzing data  in fact got better Ryan added. As for the messaging that needs to come from CEOs and other C-suite leaders about AI Ryan said clarity and transparency should lead the way. Our words matter. Be clear and never mislead anyone he said. [The adoption of AI] is going to happen over time not in an instant so dont put people in a panic. Tell them how youre going to help them stay relevant. watch now VIDEO 6:28 06:28 Top tech CEOs discussed the future of AI with senators Power Lunch',\n",
       " 'headline: Google Bard asked Bill Nye how AI can help avoid the end of the world. Heres what The Science Guy said.  content: watch now VIDEO 7:17 07:17 Watch Bill Nye respond to generative AI on how it can help save the world Technology Executive Council You may not know this but Bill Nye The Science Guy has professional experience overseeing new and potentially dangerous innovations. Before he became a celebrity science educator Nye worked as an engineer at Boeing during a period of rapid changes in aviation control systems and the need to make sure that the outputs from new systems were understood. And going all the way back to the days of the steamship engine innovation Nye says that control theory has always been a key to the introduction of new technology. It will be no different with artificial intelligence. While not an AI expert Nye said the basic problem everyone should be concerned about with AI design is that we can understand whats going into the computer systems but we cant be sure what is going to come out. Social media was an example of how this problem already has played out in the technology sector. Speaking last Tuesday at the CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit on AI in New York City Nye said that the rapid rise of AI means everyone in middle school all the way through to getting a PhD. in comp sci will have to learn about AI. But he isnt worried about the impact of the tech on students referencing the outrage surrounding the calculator. Teachers got used to them everyone has to take tests with calculators he said. This is just whats going to be. ... Its the beginning or rudiments of computer programming. More important in making people who are not computer literate understand and accept AI is good design in education. Everyone already counts on their phone to tell them what side of the street they are on Nye said. Good engineering invites right use. People throw around user-friendly but I say user figure- outtable. Overall Nye seems more worried about students not becoming well-rounded in their analytical skills than personally thinking AI is going to wipe out humanity. And to make sure the risk of the latter can be minimized he says we need to focus on the former in education. Computer science may become essential learning but underlying his belief that the universe is knowable Nye said that the most fundamental skill children need to learn is critical thinking. It will play a big role in AI he says due to both its complexity and its susceptibility to misuse such as deep fakes. Noting the influence of Carl Sagan on his own philosophy Nye said We want people to be able to question. We dont want a smaller and smaller fraction of people understanding a more complex world. During the conversation with CNBCs Tyler Mathisen at the TEC Summit on AI CNBC surprised Nye with a series of questions that came from a prompt given to the Google generative AI Bard: What should we ask Bill Nye about AI Bard came up with about 20 questions covering a lot of ground: How should we ensure AI is used for good and not harm We need regulations Nye said. What should we be teaching our children about AI How to write computer code. What do you think about the chance for AI to surpass human intelligence It already does. What is the most important ethical consideration for AI development That we need a class of legislators that can understand it well enough to create regulations to handle it monitor it he said. What role can AI play in addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems such as climate change and poverty Nye who has spent a lot of time thinking about how the world may end  he still thinks giant solar flares are a bigger risk than AI which he reminded the audience you can turn off  said this was an excellent question. He gave his most expansive responses to the AI on this point. Watch the video above to see all of Bill Nyes answers to the AI about how it can help save the world.',\n",
       " 'headline: Heres how A.I. and virtual reality can help companies boost employee engagement and productivity.  content: When it comes to solving thorny people issues like employee disengagement and lowered productivity technologies such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality will play a big role. One area where this is likely to be seen most significantly is in employee training. The ease of use and immersive nature of AI and VR are taking employee training to a whole new level said Tacy Byham chief executive officer of DDI an international human resources and leadership development consultancy company. Of course training employees with virtual reality simulations isnt new. Companies in industries from automobiles to health care have been using VR to train factory floor workers and emergency room staff for years. But with advancements in AI VR training can be used effectively for soft-skills training as well which creates an opportunity for employees to practice conversations Byham said. It also creates an immersive experience that feels safe allows you to practice and springboards you into really deep and relevant conversations. Byham has worked with VR training sessions for years since before the pandemic. She said all companies can benefit in various ways from AI and VR tech and employers should start to incorporate these tools. Increasing engagement learning and retention Some of the biggest issues slamming HR teams include lower employee engagement and the scramble to retain employees despite massive layoffs cascading through the tech industry . Frankie Cavanagh chief technology officer at Gemba a virtual reality workforce learning platform is dedicated to finding the best ways to engage people with learning. He said VR is a perfect tool to revolutionize workplace training and increase employee engagement. Youve probably seen the memes about workplace training where employees click click click things getting through online trainings as fast as possible Cavanagh said. These training are not fun theyre not engaging and you instantaneously forget about things. VR is different because it immerses employees into an experience. Its a way to help engage people and once youve engaged a learner you can pretty much teach them anything so VR is the ideal vehicle to do that Cavanagh added. watch now VIDEO 4:06 04:06 A.I. will change the profile of the workforce over time says SVB MoffettNathansons Sterling Auty Closing Bell: Overtime Learning and training through VR impacts workers in ways that traditional learning methods cant. Thats because current tools like PowerPoint slides online modules and how-to videos dont block out the outside world like VR does Cavanagh said. VR immerses an employee into a simulation of the exact topic of their learning sessions. The sheer exposure and immersion into the topic greatly help workers remember what they are learning more than conventional methods. VR has longevity in terms of retaining that information Cavanagh said. Its something that you experienced and it wasnt just that day that you sat in front of your laptop clicked through and watched the terrible online video training. Providing safe space for tough conversations Whether youre a manager that needs to give a performance review or an associate hoping to talk to your boss about a raise or promotion every employee at a company faces tough workplace conversations at some point. VR and AI can help employees work through those situations and practice what theyre going to say addressing stumbling points roadblocks and mistakes before encountering colleagues in the real world Byham said. Employees can also prepare for the kinds of responses they might receive in return. In these VR settings virtual humans could have a positive negative or neutral response to what an employee might say making them better equipped to respond to similar emotions displayed in an actual conversation in the workplace. Lets say youre in a scenario where you need to talk to an employee about the deadlines that theyve been missing Byham said. The employee in the VR responds with What do you mean Listen youve thrown six different assignments at me. How are you ever going to expect me to get all this done at the same time In this virtual scenario with emotions high the manager has time to think about how to respond when this or something similar happens in real life she added. Its the ultimate responsibility of a leader to help lower the emotion in the room Byham said. Theyre supposed to listen connect with you and help employees feel heard. These VR simulations help leaders break through and get into more in-depth performance conversations. You can have people see a movie listen to a podcast or receive good advice about how to have a performance conversation but until youve actually stepped in and tried to do it yourself youre not going to be able to change or improve your behavior Byham said. Incorporating advanced technology While Byham and Cavanagh agree that VR and AI tech stands to benefit employees at all levels of a company incorporating these tools is not a one-step fix-all solution. The incorporation of these tools provides the first step in a longer journey to VR tech adoption. Byham also urges companies to look at the feasibility of what it takes to incorporate these VR tools into their specific workplaces. Constraints like budget equipment and IT support could be hindrances to a company starting to use VR tools she said. Among the questions to address: Do you keep this equipment at the office and expect people to come in or do you provide it remotely Do you need more IT support to be able to support VR Whats your budget for VR investments Do you have the right kind of facilitators who can help run the program and debrief the programs To what extent are managers helping support people in their journey You cant just leave it to HR to be the only ones Byham said. You need to make sure that youve got managers who are there listening providing support providing the coaching. Its one of the most important levers to ensure people will use VR and really create behavior change.',\n",
       " 'headline: Why some college professors are adopting ChatGPT AI as quickly as students.  content: Its no longer news that one of the first professional sectors threatened by the rapid adoption of ChatGPT and generative AI is education  universities and colleges around the country convened emergency meetings to discuss what to do about the risk of students using AI to cheat on their work. Theres another side to that evolving AI story. Recent research from professors at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School New York University and Princeton suggests that educators should be just as worried about their own jobs. In an analysis of professions most exposed to the latest advances in large language models like ChatGPT eight of the top 10 are teaching positions. When we ran our analysis I was surprised to find that educational occupations come out close to the top in many cases said Robert Seamans co-author of the new research study and professor at NYU. Post-secondary teachers in English language and literature foreign language and history topped the list among educators. While evidence has been growing in recent years that work within highly skilled professions  for example lawyers  may be influenced by AI typically the jobs expected to be most affected by technology are routine or rote jobs while highly-skilled labor is considered more protected. But this study finds the opposite to be the case. Highly-skilled jobs may be more affected than others said Manav Raj co-author and professor at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School. But affected jobs  or as the study officially describes it jobs most exposed to AI   does not necessarily mean the human positions will be replaced. ChatGPT can be used to help professors generate syllabi or to recommend readings that are relevant to a given topic said Raj who is not currently concerned about the fear of replacement. It can also design educational slides and in-class exercises. And for topics that are very dense ChatGPT can even help educators translate some of those lessons or takeaways in simpler language he said. watch now VIDEO 5:25 05:25 A.I. and education can go hand and hand says Khan Academys Sal Khan The Exchange Education technology company Udemy has been selling language learning modules made with ChatGPT to help language teachers design their courses. Duolingo  the popular online language learning company is relying on AI technology to power its Duolingo English Test (DET) an English proficiency exam available online on demand. The test utilizes ChatGPT to generate text passages for reading comprehension and AI for supporting human proctors in spotting suspicious test-taking behavior. It is also working with teachers to generate lesson content and speed up the process and scale of adding advanced materials to the platform. Since not everyone in the world has equal access to great teachers and favorable learning conditions AI gives us the best chance to scale quality education to everyone who needs it said Klinton Bicknell Duolingos head of AI. What college professors are thinking and doing Some professors are wary of ChatGPT and its capabilities. Kristina Reardon an English professor at Amherst College says there is a line to draw when using ChatGPT as a professor and considering ChatGPTs role of co-authorship in writing. No matter how good Chat GPT gets I believe we can gain a lot from learning to pre-write draft revise edit etc. Writing is a process and its an iterative one and one that helps us think through ideas she said. Many universities have sent out guidance to professors for use of ChatGPT and how they can augment their students experiences while still maintaining academic integrity. Princeton advises professors to be explicit in the uses of ChatGPT in their syllabi use it to enhance smaller group discussions and use it as a tool to compare students own drafts of essays with a ChatGPT version. At Cornell University regardless of general university guidelines every instructor will be free to make their own decision on what works best for their area of teaching says Morten Christiansen psychology professor at the school. Many professors are starting to use ChatGPT in the classroom. Laurent Dubreuil professor in French and comparative literature at Cornell is currently having his students assess the boundaries of academic freedom and censorship as the most recent versions of ChatGPT are now coming with set parameters about what is socially and politically acceptable to say  and what should not be uttered. Christiansen says ChatGPT can help level the playing field among students. It can be used as a personal tutor to help them and theres an opportunity for students to evaluate what ChatGPT produces he said. In fact the technologys imperfections are an opportunity to teach and learn in new ways honing students critical analysis skills by prompting them to ask ChatGPT specific questions related to course content and critique the answers given back to them. Many current generative AI language models produce what AI experts have deemed hallucinations. ChatGPT will make things up and it will look like it is really confident in what it is saying including adding references that dont actually exist Christiansen said. Ethan Mollick entrepreneurship professor at Wharton who has become an evangelist within the education world for generative AI experimentation expects his students to use ChatGPT in every document they produce whether this is for marketing materials graphics blog posts or even new working apps. I think we have to realize its part of our lives and we have to figure out how to work with that he said. Mollick does not think exposure means eventual replacement. We have to recognize that we need to change how we approach things and embrace this new technology he said. Weve adapted to other technological changes and I think this one we will adapt to as well. watch now VIDEO 8:16 08:16 Can Chinas ChatGPT clones give it an edge over the U.S. in an A.I. arms race International Digital Originals',\n",
       " 'headline: Singapore is not looking to regulate A.I. just yet says the city-states authority.  content: As governments deliberate on whether artificial intelligence poses risks or dangers and whether it needs regulating Singapore is taking more of a wait-and-see approach. We are currently not looking at regulating AI Lee Wan Sie director for trusted AI and data at Singapores Infocomm Media Development Authority told CNBC. IMDA promotes and regulates Singapores communication and media sectors. The Singapore government is making efforts to promote the responsible use of AI. It is calling for companies to collaborate in the worlds first AI testing toolkit  called AI Verify   that enables users to conduct technical tests on their AI models and record process checks. We will learn how AI is being used before we decide if more needs to be done from a regulatory front. Lee Wan Sie Director for trusted AI  data IMDA AI Verify was launched as a pilot project in 2022. Tech giant IBM and Singapore Airlines have already started pilot testing as part of the program. Calls for regulation In recent months AI buzz has gathered pace after chatbot ChatGPT went viral for its ability to generate humanlike responses to users prompts. It hit 100 million users in just two months after its launch. Globally there have been repeated calls for government interventions to address the potential risks of AI however. Tech leaders such as OpenAIs CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have warned about the dangers of the technology. At this stage it is quite clear that we want to be able to learn from the industry. We will learn how AI is being used before we decide if more needs to be done from a regulatory front said Lee adding that regulation may be introduced at a later stage. We recognize that as a small country as the government we may not have all the answers to this. So its very important that we work closely with the industry research organizations and other governments said Lee.

Sometimes when it comes to regulations you see the gap between what the policymakers are thinking about AI versus whats actually happening in the business said Mahmoudian. So having this type of collaboration specifically creating these types of toolkits has the input from the industry. It really benefits both sides she added. Google  Microsoft and IBM are among tech giants which have already joined the AI Verify Foundation  a global open-source community set up to discuss AI standards and best practices as well as collaborate on governing AI. We at Microsoft applaud the Singapore governments leadership in this area said Brad Smith president and vice chair at Microsoft in a press release. By creating practical resources like the AI governance testing framework and toolkit Singapore is helping organizations build robust governance and testing processes said Smith. Collaborative approach At the Asia Tech x Singapore summit in June Singapores Minister for Communications and Information Josephine Teo noted that while the government recognizes the potential risks of AI it cannot promote the ethical use of AI on its own . The private sector with their expertise can participate meaningfully to achieve these goals with us she said. While there are very real fears and concerns about AIs development we will need to actively steer AI toward beneficial uses and away from bad ones said Teo.

Singapore has really sort of positioned itself as almost like the steward in the region of responsible and trustworthy use of AI. Stella Cramer APAC head of international law firm Clifford Chances tech group Theres just this consistent approach that were seeing around openness and collaboration. Singapore is viewed as a jurisdiction that is a safe place to come and test and roll out your technology with the support of the regulators in a controlled environment said Cramer. The city-state has launched several pilot projects such as the FinTech Regulatory Sandbox or healthtech sandbox for industry players to test out their products in a live environment before going to market. These structured frameworks and testing toolkits will help guide AI governance policies to promote safe and trustworthy AI for businesses said Cramer.

       " 'headline: AI exposure is the new buzz term to soften talk about job losses. Heres what it means.  content: watch now VIDEO 3:58 03:58 A.I. will challenge jobs where cognitive tasks are valued says Korn Ferrys Alan Guarino Squawk Box The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has raised many concerns prominent among these AI job displacement and mass layoffs throughout the economy. Unlike previous eras of technology and innovation when job loss fears centered mainly on manual work this time it is so-called white collar jobs now also referred to as knowledge worker positions  fields that are cognitively-oriented  seen as being at elevated levels of risk. No round of layoffs of knowledge workers goes by without a mention of the threat of AI. When LinkedIn recently laid off nearly 700 workers many of them engineers discussion quickly turned to AI replacing a class of highly-valued tech workers  even though to be clear there was no indication from LinkedIn that AI was involved in the decision. CNBC reporting indicated that LinkedIn was outsourcing some positions to India. But there is little doubt AI will be a suspect any time firms are reducing headcount. [AI] is going to challenge jobs where cognitive tasks are valued Alan Guarino Korn Ferry vice chairman spoke to CNBCs Andrew Ross Sorkin in a  Squawk Box  interview after the LinkedIn announcement. Previously often innovation challenged jobs where manual tasks were performed. So yes definitely engineers and various others will have to see this as a potential threat for displacement or ideally a tool that will let them do higher order work better Guarino said. And that latter point is the crux of what AI and job market forecasters still dont understand  to what extent AI will change the nature of a job that a human still does rather than replace that individual. In May of this year alone the U.S. economy lost 4000 jobs as a result of AI according to data from employment outsourcing firm Challenger Gray  Christmas. Given how often C-suite executives are discussing the technology those numbers are likely to go up. According to Factset mentions of generative AI on corporate earnings calls increased from five in December 2022 to 390 in June 2023. A recent Rand Corporation study which looks at technology patents and risk of job replacement found that even before the rise of gen AI There are no occupations in the United States that are completely unexposed to general technology patents. Rand found that to be true as of 1989. The more recent milestone according to Rand: by 2020 nearly all occupations are exposed to AI technology patent. And the key related point: In contrast to earlier decades occupations that require more education and pay higher wages have become more exposed to technology patents in general Rand concluded. A recent study from Pew Research Center finds that 19% of all workers in the U.S. are exposed to AI. In an analysis published earlier this year researchers from NYU Princeton and the Wharton School found that among professions most exposed to the latest advances in large language models like ChatGPT eight of the top 10 are teaching positions  telemarketers and sociologists were the others. Highly-skilled jobs may be more affected than others said Manav Raj co-author and professor at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School. Researchers arent trying to mask the threat of job losses in softening their talk about AI using terms like affected and exposure. The fact is it remains unclear whether exposure to AI will be positive or negative across many job functions especially the further out in time forecasts go. Ask a room of top tech executives what comes next and there is a high degree of optimism about AI at work. At this weeks CNBC Technology Executive Council Summit in New York City 75% of those in attendance indicated in a survey that AI will create more jobs in the next year than it destroys. During a panel discussion on AI and the workforce at the TEC Summit Diogo Rau Eli Lilly  Co. chief information and digital officer recounted a challenge he made to the Lilly team to come up with any job at the pharmaceutical company that would not be helped by AI. Still havent come up with one he said. Every job will benefit from AI Rau said. But he made an important distinction in discussing this view adding that AI benefit to all jobs doesnt mean humans are always going to be the ones doing the job. There will be increasing cost/benefit analysis of whether a position should be human onshore human offshore or digital and some jobs that were previously distinct roles  for example account management for creative campaigns  could effectively become folded into other positions as AI accomplishes more of the creative support task load. For now Rau said the most important aspect of AI upskilling is just having workers use AI tools. Too many people have opinions about AI without any experience using it he said. There is considerable work to be done along these lines on the part of corporate management offering AI training opportunities and being more transparent about how they are using AI  just over half of employees say they have no idea how their companies are using AI today. And workers being motivated to experiment more with the technology. Anything that makes us smarter is clearly going to enable us to save time in certain ways right so there are huge efficiencies to come here and those efficiencies will definitely change jobs. Theres going to be a reshuffling of who does what and when and I think the challenge for society is trying to make sure that we make that transition in a smooth as possible way said Mustafa Suleyman  co-founder of Googles DeepMind in an interview with CNBCs Closing Bell earlier this year. watch now VIDEO 2:43 02:43 Inflection AIs Mustafa Suleyman says A.I. will create serious number of losers in white collar work Closing Bell AI has the potential to make all employees more efficient  it can help write an email job posting marketing campaign product copy organize a list do research etc. Suleyman who is now CEO of Inflection AI which focuses on the development of personal AI tools says that every individual will have their own AI chief of staff within five years. But as AI gets smarter and more capable the potential for displacement or at least a fundamental workforce restructuring also increases. The net of it is were going to have to figure out a different way to develop people whose jobs may be displaced at lower levels of the workflow Guarino said. For example upskilling those junior coders faster through formalized training replacing what used to be on the job training. Guarino said upskilling and retraining may not only offer some protection from AI displacement but could also be positive for the economy. Over a period of time yes were going to have to find ways to upskill people so they can do higher order work faster and quite frankly that does all kinds of things like promote economic growth efficiency he said. Mario Harik CEO of logistics company XPO  who worked on AI neural nets as far back as the 1990s said at the CNBC TEC Summit that its not only important to ensure workers are getting the proper training to utilize AI tools but to reinforce the connection between these tools helping the business become more efficient and what that means for jobs. You need to make sure they are gaining new skills and are becoming more efficient by leveraging the technology as opposed to being afraid of the technology Harik said. But its also about growing more efficiently and if youre adding efficiency at a long enough arc of time the idea is that you can grow by being more efficient and grow your workforce.',\n",
       " 'headline: The modern CEO job is completely broken  but AI could make executives useful again.  content: From writers and teachers to bankers and lawyers most jobs seem ripe to be replaced by artificial intelligence  with one notable exception. The only job that seems to be safe from the rise of ChatGPT and other AI tech is oddly enough the most expensive and easily automated role: CEO. Chief executives have recently spent a lot of time threatening to replace their lazy entitled and unproductive workers with AI but they never seem to face the same level of scrutiny other employees do. Look a little closer though and it becomes clear that the role of the modern CEO is not only broken as Ive pointed out before  but it could easily be done by the technology we have now. Americas top CEOs make over 300 times more than the average worker despite the fact that their primary duty is to make easily replicable optimization decisions based not on a real understanding of the business but on inputs from spreadsheets fed to them by consultants. Far from being an actual contributor to a companys bottom line the late 20th centurys superstar CEO movement has ushered in a generation of executives who operate mainly as figureheads with little actual responsibility or accountability. The solution is fairly simple: We must hold CEOs accountable in the same way that we do their employees or dissolve the role entirely. A chief executive must meaningfully contribute in a way that is measurable and delivers clear value for the company. Failing that I would argue that the opaque role of the CEO should be the first one to be replaced by artificial intelligence. An AI model would likely give quicker answers be in a continual state of self-improvement take feedback instantly and deliver the same kind of operational efficiency for which the current crop of CEOs are paid millions of dollars a year. As the comedian Scott Seiss succinctly put it in a late-July TikTok post: Lets replace our employees with AI Lets replace our CEOs with AI. Actually AI is too advanced for that job all you need is a Fisher Price tape recorder loaded up with a bad bunch of ideas. If its broke then fix it CEOs like to project an image of invincibility  without them the directionless company will fall apart. You cant replace me the attitude screams Im just too valuable. So what exactly is it that these executives are doing on a daily basis that creates so much value A 2018 Harvard study of 27 CEOs tried to answer this question. The final report put the executives various tasks into impressive-sounding buckets like people and relationships functional and business unit reviews and strategy. But digging deeper its clear that these painfully vague allocations of time are masking the fact that executives have a great deal of trouble telling you what they do for a living. Most of the time is spent in meetings talking about strategy and making big calls rather than contributing meaningfully to the organization through either experience or actual execution. Even when major CEOs are given the chance to clearly state the value they offer to a company it comes across as noxious word salad. The former Procter  Gamble CEO A.G. Lafley wrote a 2009 Harvard Business Review article called  What Only the CEO Can Do . Once described as the most successful CEO in PG History Lafley made as much as $19.5 million a year in his role. Heres how he described to role of CEO: The CEO alone experiences the meaningful outside at an enterprise level and is responsible for understanding it interpreting it advocating for it and presenting it so that the company can respond in a way that enables sustainable sales profit and total shareholder return (TSR) growth. He also incorrectly stated that the CEO can see opportunities that others dont see and make the judgments and tough calls others are unable to make thanks to being the one person whose boss isnt another company employee. Can you imagine any Procter  Gamble employee bringing such a vapid and generic answer to their manager Can you imagine telling your boss that what you did today was interpreting the meaningful outside Lafley appears to summarize his position and value to the company as someone who doesnt actually do or have any responsibility for anything while also holding more power than anyone else in the organization. Alternatively imagine asking any old AI model to describe the job of a CEO. It would probably spit out something much better than balancing sufficient yield in the present with necessary investment in the future. It isnt as if executives cant be useful for a company. A chief financial officer focuses on cash flow makes sure the taxes are paid and ensures the financial statements of the company are properly prepared. A chief security officer makes sure employees dont get hacked or ensures the physical safety of workers. By contrast a chief executive has become a figurehead who makes calls based on vibes with the occasional meeting or press hit mixed in. Lets replace our employees with AI Lets replace our CEOs with AI. Dont get me wrong  a company does generally need a figurehead and you need someone with a companywide perspective who can guide an organization and make decisions. You need someone who defines the mission and then holds the company to that mission. But if the executives only role is to make these decisions with no other contribution to or accountability for the results the role loses much of its value. Chief executives have become the Final Managers  disconnected ideas guys like Elon Musk who get credit for every major success without being fired for a single major failure . Without connecting their outsize pay to the results of their decisions there is no reason to have a CEO. If the job of a chief executive is simply to take data and regurgitate extrapolations that deliver efficiency I can think of no role more appropriate for AI replacement. Stars in their eyes David Zaslav the CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery has been a major part of the reason that the Hollywood strikes have gone on for months. Zaslav  who made $39 million last year  along with the other members of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers have helped suck as much as $5 billion out of the California economy (and the entertainment industry). And its not as if his business decision-making at his own company is earning high marks with investors either: Since the merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery in 2022 the companys combined market capitalization has dropped by $20 billion. An executive who has never had to directly contribute to the product that produces the revenue to pay his ... salary is the most easily automated job of all time. Perhaps the most galling part about his leadership of one of Hollywoods flagship studios is the fact that he appears to never have been involved in the ground-level process of making a movie TV show podcast or any other creative pursuit. Zaslav began his career as a lawyer and has spent decades working in media in various strategic capacities but his utter disconnection from the process of creativity has helped prolong this costly painful strike. He and the other studio heads seem to believe entertainment is a commodity that can be automated and produced at will . Since the merger the CEOs most notable creative decisions have been to cancel shows yank content from the companys streaming services and shelve already-completed movies all in the name of saving money. These arent the moves of an executive passionate about creating high-quality entertainment that will win the publics dollars its the type of eye-glazing number crunching that could be done by feeding an Excel spreadsheet into an AI model. An executive who has never had to directly contribute to the product that produces the revenue to pay his (its almost always a man ) salary is the most easily automated job of all time. Executives who only make calls sign contracts or give vapid media interviews are not doing work  theyre glorified productivity software a barely relevant regurgitation machine built from a core of privilege and exploitation. These CEOs dont do the work they just query a database of other executives and actual workers to make calls without any practical experience or actual conviction behind the decision kind of like ChatGPT. The difference is that when CEOs hallucinate it tends to cost thousands of people their jobs . And almost every one of those layoff announcements refers to efficiency or necessary changes yet never acknowledges the biggest stupidest expenditure of them all: a vacuously defined public steward who makes more than anybody else at the company. Chief executives have become part of the managerial-industrial complex  an entire section of the economy for people who dont contribute anything other than demanding others do their work. Management is not a job unless you have the core experience of the thing you are managing at such a level that you could actually do it yourself. The CEO of a tech company should be able to code or build or design. The CEO of an entertainment company should have been directly involved in the creation of successful movies or television shows. Id even go as far as to say that the CEO of an airline should be able either to fly a plane or to handle multiple shifts a year as a steward on one. What better way can we hold a chief executive accountable than making sure they actually execute A CEO should be someone who has an active role in the profit generation of the business either through actively building the company or through closing the deals and partnerships that will generate said revenue. Said chief executives must also be held directly accountable to real metrics and have their pay tied directly to the success of the business the happiness of the business customers and the happiness of their employees. From my own experience companies thrive (and great workers stay) when they feel that their boss works as hard as they do and can actually express what it is they do on a day-to-day basis. In my own life running a tech PR agency  I take responsibility for new business pitching writing and media training  the same jobs that the people working for me do because no work at a company is below its chief executive. Define what a CEO is set the terms of their success and then hold them accountable. If you cant do that you dont need a CEO. Or perhaps your CEO needs to make a more modest income. Or perhaps the chief executives need to be far more afraid of losing their jobs to equally capable robots. Ed Zitron is the CEO of EZPR  a national tech and business public-relations agency.

       " 'headline: Google had a Kodak moment last year as Microsoft takes lead in AI strategist says.  content: Google last year had a Kodak moment when it came to artificial intelligence giving rival Microsoft an edge with the technology one strategist told CNBC on Wednesday. Cyrus Mewawalla head of thematic intelligence at GlobalData called AI the big theme of 2023 and said that Microsoft has stolen a lead on Google with its investment in OpenAI  the company behind ChatGPT. Microsoft is currently winning this race in AI Mewawalla told CNBCs Squawk Box Europe. ChatGPT is a viral AI chatbot that is trained on large amounts of data to give responses to user queries. Microsoft has announced plans to integrate ChatGPT into some cloud computing products as it looks to infuse AI across its business. Google under parent Alphabet  has been investing in AI for years. The company acquired British AI start-up Deepmind in 2014 to supercharge its efforts with the technology. Last week Alphabet merged its Google Research team Brain with DeepMind in a bid to bring the arms closer and concentrate its AI efforts. Mewawalla said this should have been done a long time ago and that Google even though it has great AI fell behind Microsoft last year. In a way in 2022 it (Google) had a Kodak moment. It had the leading product but it kept it aside for fear that it could cannibalize its core business. Now its core business is under massive threat Mewawalla. watch now VIDEO 3:37 03:37 Artificial intelligence market could eventually be worth trillions analyst says Squawk Box Europe Googles search product is the tech giants core business. Microsoft has also been integrating OpenAI technology into its search product Bing . A Kodak moment is a phrase used to describe the inability to foresee future trends. It references camera firm Eastman Kodak Company which failed to transition into the digital age. In response to Microsoft Google launched its own chatbot called Bard AI this year and has begun testing it with users . Sundar Pichai CEO of Alphabet said on a Tuesday earnings call that the company will be bringing the AI technology behind Bard into search products in the future. Analysts said that while Google has strong AI technology it hasnt brought it into products fast enough as Microsoft has done. Googles issue is that they have the brightest minds in AI they have the rockstars they have a third of the top hundred cited papers in AI but theyre an engineering-led company and they have not productized what theyve done Richard Kramer senior analyst at Arete Research told CNBCs Worldwide Exchange. Some analysts see Alphabets investment in AI over the years as giving it an advantage going forward. JPMorgan said in a note published Wednesday that Alphabet is well positioned in AI through years of investments across its business lines and is accelerating efforts around commercializing the technology behind AI chatbots known as large language models. Executives talked up the companys prowess and investments in AI during Alphabets first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday. Ruth Porat CFO of Alphabet said that the company will increase its capital expenditure this year from 2022 with AI being a key component of that. Pichai said Alphabet is infusing its AI technology across many different products. First the incredible AI opportunity for consumers our partners and for our business. Ive compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago.

       " 'headline: Bill Gates explains why we shouldnt be afraid of A.I..  content: Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is a believer in the potential of artificial intelligence repeating often that he believes models like the one at the heart of ChatGPT are the most important advancement in technology since the personal computer. The technologys emergence could lead to issues like deepfakes biased algorithms and cheating in school he says but he predicts that the problems stemming from the technology are solvable. One thing thats clear from everything that has been written so far about the risks of AI  and a lot has been writtenis that no one has all the answers Gates wrote in a blog post this week . Another thing thats clear to me is that the future of AI is not as grim as some people think or as rosy as others think. Gates broadcasting a middle-of-the-road view to AI risks could shift the debate around the technology away from doomsday scenarios towards more limited regulation addressing current risks just as governments around the world grapple with how to regulate the technology and its potential downfalls. For example on Tuesday senators received a classified briefing about AI and the military. Gates is one of the most prominent voices about artificial intelligence and its regulation. Hes also still closely affiliated with Microsoft which has invested in OpenAI and integrated its ChatGPT into its core products including Office. In the blog post Gates cites how society reacted to previous advancements to make the case that humans have adapted to major changes in the past and they will do so for AI as well. For example it will have a big impact on education but so did handheld calculators a few decades ago and more recently allowing computers in the classroom Gates wrote. Gates suggests that the kind of regulation the technology needs is speed limits and seat belts. Soon after the first automobiles were on the road there was the first car crash. But we didnt ban cars  we adopted speed limits safety standards licensing requirements drunk-driving laws and other rules of the road Gates wrote. Gates is worried about some of the challenges arising from the adoption of the technology including how it could change peoples jobs and hallucination or the propensity for models like ChatGPT to invent facts documents and people. For example he cites the problem of deepfakes which use AI models to allow people to easily make fake videos that impersonate another person and which could be used to scam people or tip elections he writes. But he also suspects that people will get better at identifying deepfakes and cites deepfake detectors being developed by Intel and DARPA a government funder. He proposes regulation that would clearly outline what kind of deepfakes are legal to make. He also worries about the ability of AI-generated code to search for the kind of software vulnerabilities needed to hack computers and suggests a global regulatory body modeled after the International Atomic Energy Agency.',\n",
       " 'headline: The worlds top H.P. Lovecraft expert weighs in on a monstrous viral meme in the A.I. world.  content: Artificial intelligence is scary to a lot of people even within the tech world. Just look at how industry insiders have co-opted a tentacled monster called a shoggoth as a semi-tongue-in-cheek symbol for their rapidly advancing work. But their online memes and references to that creature  which originated in influential late author H.P. Lovecrafts novella At the Mountains of Madness  arent quite perfect according to the worlds leading Lovecraft scholar S.T. Joshi. If anyone knows Lovecraft and his wretched menagerie which includes the ever-popular Cthulhu its Joshi . Hes edited reams of Lovecraft collections contributed scores of essays about the author and written more than a dozen books about him including the monumental two-part biography I Am Providence. So after The New York Times recently published a piece from tech columnist Kevin Roose explaining that the shoggoth had caught on as the most important meme in A.I. CNBC reached out to Joshi to get his take  and find out what he thought Lovecraft would say about the squirmy homage from the tech world. While Im sure Lovecraft would be grateful (and amused) by the application of his creation to AI the parallels are not very exact Joshi wrote. Or I should say it appears that AI creators arent entirely accurate in their understanding of the shoggoth. Read more: How to talk about AI like an insider First of all its shoggoth not Shoggoth Joshi said. The capitalized version of the word as its spelled in the Times article has indeed appeared in many editions of At the Mountains of Madness which was first published in Astounding Stories in 1936 the year before Lovecraft died at age 46. But decades ago Joshi found that Lovecraft himself made it lowercase in his manuscript and typescript of the science fiction/horror tale set in Antarctica. It is a species name not a proper name Joshi wrote in an email to CNBC. But thats a minor quibble. There are bigger thematic things to consider. Workers and others in the generative-AI field use the shoggoth meme which often appears as a squiggly cartoon festooned with eyes and appendages to acknowledge the mysterious at-times frightening potential of the technology. That some A.I. insiders refer to their creations as Lovecraftian horrors even as a joke is unusual by historical standards Roose wrote in his Times column. The recent advancement of generative AI has already provoked references to science fiction classics such as The Terminator and The Matrix or Harlan Ellisons chilling science fiction story  I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream  all of which portray sinister artificial intelligence wiping out most of humanity. Bringing Lovecrafts cosmic horrors into the mix might seem excessive at this point even as the technology creates uncanny things. For instance a recent fake Toronto Blue Jays ad created by a TSN producer who used text-to-video AI tech is packed with horrifying images such as people feasting on each others hot dog tentacles. The shoggoth memes creator  known by the Twitter handle TetraspaceWest said the inspiration came about because Lovecrafts monsters are indifferent and their priorities are totally alien to us and dont involve humans which is what I think will be true about possible future powerful A.I. Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards The meme also tries to put a happy face on the shoggoth  literally  as it usually depicts the monster sporting a smile emoji on a tentacle. Thats in reference to efforts to train language models to be nice according to the Times. It also reads like a commentary on how futile and absurd it might be to try. Lovecrafts shoggoths probably wouldnt entertain the idea of sending a friendly signal and in the story they certainly arent indifferent to their creators whom they try to usurp. While artificial intelligence is based in machines the monsters in the novella are organically bred slave creatures that develop brains and their own will Joshi pointed out. Lovecraft describes a shoggoth as a column of foetid black iridescence consisting of protoplasmic bubbles faintly self-luminous and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and unforming as pustules of greenish light. A big concern among people who fear AI is that the programs will someday become more intelligent than humans and take over. There is no parallel event in Lovecrafts story. The shoggoths dont end up surpassing their masters the ancient Old Ones in intelligence or any other capacity Joshi writes. Lovecraft clearly states otherwise. Thats not to say the meme totally misses the mark. In the story shoggoths rise up against the Old Ones in a series of slave revolts that surely contribute to the collapse of the Old Ones society Joshi notes. The AI anxiety that inspired comparisons to the cartoon monster image certainly resonates with the ultimate fate of that society. So the general metaphor of an artificial creation overwhelming its creator does have some sort of parallel to AI (or the fears of what AI might do in the future) but its a fairly inexact parallel Joshi wrote. But even this imperfect metaphor pairs well with what happens in Lovecrafts story which describes a once-grand civilization that had too many problems to fix. In our world  a world beset by toxic wildfire smoke and water shortages violent insurrections in democracies and the most military combat in Europe since World War II  AI is just part of a whole. Theres a lot of hype and confusion around it as well as positive potential. There are also real concerns namely in how AI could act as an accelerant for bigotry and extremism or as an engine for misinformation or as a job killer. In the novella the Old Ones fall prey to a variety of threats including attacks from rival entities who come from outer space. The story ends with insinuations of even greater mind-shattering horrors that lay beyond the mountains of madness. In reality humans could well scale those terrible heights with the help of AI but only if we let it happen. Maybe we should be the ones wearing the smiley faces.',\n",
       " 'headline: Why graphic designers think generative A.I. needs them as much as they need it.  content: As generative artificial intelligence programs producing images such as OpenAIs DALL-E Midjourney and Adobe s Firefly take off graphic designers  many of whom operate as sole proprietorships  cant ignore the usefulness of a tool that helps them to better meet the endless demand for visual content. But amid fears that AI will supplant creative professionals they are exploiting a current limitation in the technology: the results are only as good as the human mind prompting the A.I. programs. The advances in AI affecting the world of graphic design are much of the same advances were seeing elsewhere said Nicola Hamilton president of the Association of Registered Graphic Designers. ChatGPT is becoming increasingly capable of doing our writing and planning while Midjourney and DALL-E are creating pretty advanced artwork when given the right prompts she said. For Hamilton and many graphic designers dealing with new technology is nothing new  its core to the evolution of their creative profession dating back all the way to the democratization of printing through the introduction of computers the birth of the internet and the prevalence of social media. Graphic design is a fairly young profession. Originally we were tradespeople (printers typesetters sign painters) and our common understanding of design is tightly tied to both the popularization of advertising and the technological revolution Hamilton said. How much time does generative AI save As designers experiment with gen AI they are starting to answer a few big questions that surface amid any professional technology advance: How much time do the new tools really save designers And can designers maintain the upper hand over the tech The most promising (or terrifying) work in AI-generative artwork seems to be coming from Midjourney Hamilton said. She pointed to a project she saw presented at the Design Thinkers conference in Vancouver in June as an example of how to answer these questions. Pum Lefebure co-founder  chief creative officer at Washington D.C.-based agency Design Army created a campaign with the help of Midjourney for a high-end eyewear retailer Georgetown Optician  a fictitious planet of giant eyeballs . Its visually stunning but as she revealed on stage was a massive undertaking to create. Learning how to prompt the AI still requires an extensive knowledge of image making and a lot of hours Hamilton said. Jake Lefebure Pums husband and co-founder and CEO of Design Army said his firm sees AI as a tool not a solution. We use AI in a way that is more a creative tool process as opposed to how a lot of people envision it: tell it what to do and all your problems can be solved. As an image board or mood board working alongside the designer across many iterations of a campaign AI can play an important role Lefebure said. But he added It takes a lot of finessing and you really need to train the AI. You need to craft the vocabulary to get the results you want. Its not a mind reader. If how a designer articulates and phrases prompts dictates the results that may become among the proprietary advantages at work in competition for campaigns. Lefebure did not want to discuss any best practices his firm has learned about generating successful image generation results. Manipulating imagery is not a new practice for graphic design professionals. Stock photography for example has always played a role in the creative process. We use AI as a tool to create with not something to just spit out into a design Lefebure said. Adobes importance in the gen AI image era While the names of the emergent generative AI starups such as OpenAI and Midjourney are first becoming known to many these innovations are also beginning to be incorporated into the design products from one of the most successful companies in the SP 500 Adobe. Hamilton said new AI applications are rolling out across Adobe products more slowly but they are making big impressions. Adobe Photoshops new AI Generative Fill is turning a lot of heads right now she said. I dont know how many designers know it by that name right now. Ive been seeing each individual application of Firefly as a tool in its respective program  mostly applied through Photoshop. That being said Adobe has a pretty tight grip on the industry. Once they move a feature out of beta itll be industry standard in no time. Sole proprietor graphic designers competing with design firms may see the ubiquity of AI in such tools as time-savers and workload scalers. Hamilton says one of the most-repeated statements about AI is that its just a tool. But she said there are multiple specific examples of the way small to medium-sized design studios are making it a useful tool today. Among these examples: to build workback schedules (a reverse timeline calendar of tasks to meet project deadlines) to write rough drafts of client copy and to build better mockups to present to clients. Right now the best thing designers can do is think of AI as a playground  its a place to experiment so that we can get to know the tool and begin to better understand the possible applications she said. watch now VIDEO 5:06 05:06 Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen says Firefly A.I. is a creative co-pilot for Photoshop users Closing Bell: Overtime There are legal complexities to sort out. While some image firms have leaned into the generative AI space as a business opportunity such as Shutterstock  Getty Images is among core creative asset vendors that taking legal action on copyright grounds. One of the biggest concerns around AI and the design industry right now is copyright and Hamilton noted that many of the generative image applications dont own the artwork they are referencing. Once that artwork has been generated who owns it then Can designers put it out into the world as their own Can they sell it to a client to use as advertising Itll be years before weve regulated the ways AI-generated artwork is licensed which is why its best to think about this space as a playground for now she said. Adobe Photoshop will make it easy for students and young designers to generate AI campaigns and the legal issues wont be sorted out before those campaigns hit the market but Lefebure said whats more important is that these results wont measure up to the level of competition from strong creative firms where AI is part of the process not the process. If you want to be original you need an idea behind that. True artists dont use Adobe gen AI just to throw a cat into a design because you need a cat he said. There has to be a reason and purpose behind how you use it. Demand for visual content has skyrocketed At Adobe executives are pushing the playground concept and being careful in saying that AI image generation should be part of a larger creative process. The key use cases we see for generative AI in graphic design fall into inspiration  as a component into a mood board for example and composition  as an asset in a workflow to create an output for print or digital said Katie Gregorio senior director of creative cloud marketing at Adobe. She pointed to past innovations as a guide. As creators adopted new technologies the creative processes adapted new possibilities opened up and more innovation occurred she said. Sven Travis associate professor of media and design at the Parsons School of Design The New School said while Firefly is one of many gen AI image tools what distinguishes it is being integrated into the Adobe universe. Most graphic designers live within the Adobe ecosystem so Firefly will be used and will eventually eclipse most of the other tools he said. With Firefly Gregorio said work that used to take hours can be compressed into minutes. Creatives can generate images from a detailed text description with Text-to-Image apply styles and textures to text fonts with a written prompt use a brush to remove objects or paint in new ones from text descriptions with Generative Fill in Photoshop and generate color variations of vector-based graphics with everyday language using Generative Recolor in Adobe Illustrator. watch now VIDEO 3:42 03:42 Adobe upgraded and Salesforce downgraded at Morgan Stanley TechCheck Gregorio said that the majority of Adobe users who range from solo freelancers to designers at the worlds biggest enterprises say that they have adopted generative AI because it puts hours back into their lives at a moment when both the demand for content and the demands on their time have skyrocketed. We are seeing this concern at every level: large enterprises and small businesses are faced with this content supply chain issue. They cannot deliver enough content fast enough especially given the exploding demand for more personalized custom-made content and we see generative-AI tools as a big part of the solution she said. For designers this can all help in making a living according to Travis. AI can be hugely helpful in production and idea generation and that saves time for small business operators he said. That goes for idea generation through text as much as image generation Travis said with ChatGPT the best example. You are a small designer and have a client charge. Feed it into ChatGPT. Cycle through the output. You will very quickly come up with a variety of ideas for project execution  some you have already thought of many you havent. Some will be viable many wont. But GPT accelerates this process tremendously he said. Then designers can take the ChatGPT results and feed them into Firefly or Midjourney. See what comes out. Revise the input. Repeat he added. Hard to be authentic in artificial world Recent history shows digital tools can quickly become invisible and simply part of the way work is done. Designers who quickly become adept at getting the most out of the new tools can draw slightly ahead of the pack  for the time being  until the general capacity of the pack is up to speed. Generative AI may yet prove different with a seemingly unlimited capacity for what it can do. It will likely make some designers redundant Hamilton said. In the same way that Canva made some designers redundant or the introduction of computers pushed some folks out of the industry. Its all the more reason to dabble now to get acquainted with the technology and to look for ways we can make it work for us she added. But the design experts say they will have to be proven wrong in the future about machines ability to supplant humanitys creative edge. Many AI experts have said that in knowledge-based work the bet they are making is that humans with AI replace humans without it rather than machines replacing humans. The underlying notion of what it means to be a graphic designer hasnt changed Travis said. It is about creating effective visual communication. AI cant tell us when we have achieved effective visual communications. Where designers have been left behind he said is when they refuse to embrace new technologies. They were never replaced by those technologies Travis said. As powerful as the tool is  and it already has proven it can create hyper-realistic output  its the prompt Lefebure said. AI wont just make things because its bored. It might someday but today it takes a human to prompt an idea and that is uniquely distinct to that creator he said. Its hard to be authentic living in an artificial world.',\n",
       " 'headline: How AI and better pay can address the ongoing cyber talent shortage.  content: The cybersecurity skills shortage has been going on for years and its getting worse with a rising number of firms citing the issue. Nearly three-quarters (71%) of IT and cybersecurity professionals worldwide surveyed earlier this year said their organizations had been impacted by the cybersecurity skills shortage according to a report from research firm Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG) and the cybersecurity professional organization Information Systems Security Association. Thats a sharp increase from 57% who cited the skills gap in a study released by ESG in July 2022. The worsening shortage has led to an increased workload for cybersecurity teams unfilled open job requisitions and high burnout among staff according to survey respondents. Nearly all of them said the cybersecurity skills shortage and its associated impacts have not improved over the past few years and 54% said it has gotten worse. While there certainly has been a [rise] in cybersecurity education programs the skills shortage has gotten worse due to increasing demand for talent said Jon Oltsik distinguished analyst and ESG fellow. Organizations need bigger staffs due to their growing IT footprint and the cybersecurity complexity. So what can companies do to get more cyber talent when there are so few professionals to be had AI to the rescue Artificial intelligence particularly generative AI might play a growing role in easing the skills shortage. Since CISOs cant hire their way out of the skills shortage they need to lean on three things: process automation advanced analytics and managed services Oltsik said. Generative AI has the potential to help in all three areas. Generative AI can help aggregate security data suggest next steps to make enhancements and even take automated actions if configured to do so Oltsik said. This can improve staff efficiency and productivity he said. Gen AI can also piggyback on analytics engines to aid security analysts in areas such as alert triage and security investigations Oltsik said. The technology can also help train cybersecurity analysts he said. It should be noted that [gen AI] for security is still in its genesis stage and not widely deployed Oltsik said. Many CISOs I talk to remain skeptical and plan on taking a more pragmatic approach to adoption. This might change over the next 12 to 18 months he added. As a cybersecurity professional I would have to advise organizations to be extremely careful when using generative artificial intelligence and ensure that whatever form of AI or machine learning that is considered be a mature product or solution said Candy Alexander the immediate past president of ISSA International and CISO and practice lead at business management consultancy NeuEon LLC. Gen AI and large language models are still very much in their infancy and are known to have bias Alexander said. Imagine the possibility of manipulating some of the [gen AI applications] and LLMs with corrupt knowledge pools. Still there is potential for gain. I believe this is an area to watch and perhaps experiment with Alexander said. It is tough to verify [gen AI] and LLM at this point. Its kind of like the Wild West at the moment. Others are more favorable toward AI as a solution today. Generative AI could help organizations bridge cyber security skills and talent shortages with on-the-job training and as a virtual team member said Jason Shockey senior vice president and CISO at mortgage servicer Cenlar FSB. Lets say an organization has an inexperienced member of its cyber team which is a common scenario Shockey said. Cyber security trainees require hours of coaching and mentoring to be effective and deliver results. From time to time senior team members are unable to mentor because they must focus on their own tasks and leave the inexperienced workers to themselves. Generative AI could be leveraged to increase the knowledge and work rate of those inexperienced people by completing repetitive tasks and revealing knowledge blind spots  like a job aid or virtual cybersecurity mentor Shockey said. Generative AI could also be used as a virtual team member when theres a personnel gap Shockey said. For example an organizations cyber team just lost their lead security architect and are finding it challenging to backfill that gap he said. The team could bridge that gap by letting generative AI evaluate data and review architectures from a security perspective. In other words you can treat generative AI as a virtual member of the cyber team. Addressing the shortage through training better pay Another thing organizations can do to attract more security talent is to make the jobs they need to fill more appealing to candidates. A good place to start is pay. Fifty-nine percent of ESG survey respondents cited increasing compensation as a way to be more competitive in attracting talent so its clear that security pros are often underpaid Oltsik said. Aside from money organizations can offer to pay for incentives such as certifications and travel/expenses at industry events. The research shows that professionals want continuous training and career development Oltsik said. Human resources teams and recruiters often post unrealistic job requirements for cyber jobs such as entry-level positions requiring five years of experience Oltsik said. Security pros believe that its important to cast a wider net find talented individuals with good analytical and problem-solving skills and train them accordingly he said. Casting a wider net can include looking more broadly within and outside the organization beyond those who are security experts. In order to maximize the organizations potential to close their cyber talent and skills shortage outreach to all people in the [organization] is required said Shockey. That wider cast net makes it more likely to find the needed cyber talent Shockey said. If the existing workforce is small no problem. Offer external viable candidates the opportunity to get assessed and matched to see if theyre a good fit for the organizations security team. CISOs and other cybersecurity leaders need to make sure that senior business executives grasp the importance of acquiring the needed skills. It appears there is misalignment of the security strategy at organizations said Alexander. Business leadership doesnt fully understand the function of cybersecurity and what skills are needed to fill positions or to simply keep up with technology she says. Its kind of like having a fighter jet that gets updated every couple of years and if the pilot isnt trained [or] certified to fly it it can be dangerous Alexander said. It is important that business executives continually talk with cybersecurity leaders and for cyber leaders to communicate to business leaders including HR in business terms she said.',\n",
       " 'headline: A.I. is helping hackers make better phishing emails.  content: IT and security leaders are concerned about the impact of artificial intelligence on cybersecurity  and rightfully so. Cyber criminals and other bad actors can do things faster and easier with AI which makes it more difficult for CISOs and other cybersecurity experts to protect their organizations. One of the primary ways cyber criminals are leveraging AI is to increase the efficacy of phishing emails and other social engineering attacks said Brian Finch co-leader of the cybersecurity data protection  privacy practice at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. Historically phishing emails have been somewhat easy to spot thanks to sloppy drafting Finch said. In particular phishing emails created by a hacker unfamiliar with a certain language [have] tended to be easy to spot due to poor grammar illogical vocabulary and bad spelling. Such glaring errors were easy to pick up by automated defenses as well as reasonably careful people he added. But AI allows many more people  regardless of their language skills  to quickly and cheaply generate convincing text for use in phishing emails Finch said. With AI tools it is now far more likely that a phishing email will appear genuine leading to more potential victims actually clicking on malicious links. Here are three steps cybersecurity leaders can take to strengthen their organizations cybersecurity programs in the age of AI. Using AI to defend against AI One of the most effective things organizations can do to better defend against the latest AI-assisted attacks is deploy tools and services that leverage AI. That means keeping up on the latest technology offerings and hiring people with the needed AI skills to use these products or retraining existing staff so that they can use them effectively. Advanced technologies such as machine learning algorithms anomaly detection and real-time monitoring can play a pivotal role in identifying and responding to potential security breaches or malicious activities said Kyle Kappel U.S. leader of cyber at KPMG. By leveraging these tools organizations can enhance their ability to detect prevent and respond to security events effectively. Executives need to prioritize the allocation of leadership and resources to ensure their AI security program remains current and proactive in the face of evolving threats Kappel said. This means appointing people with expertise in AI security to leadership positions and empowering them with the necessary tools and authority to stay on top of the latest developments in the field he said. By having dedicated personnel overseeing AI security organizations can effectively assess the risks posed by emerging threats and devise appropriate countermeasures Kappel said. Update employee training programs If an organization is using older methods of training employees  including the C-suite  about how to avoid falling prey to attackers it might be more likely to experience a data breach or other security incident. Training programs need to be updated just like tools need to be enhanced in this new security environment. AI is so new that most people including business executives dont really understand how it can be used for malicious purposes Finch said. Business leaders need to educate themselves and their employees about the emerging negative uses of AI. For example employees need to be taught about what to look for in AI-generated phishing emails given that cybercriminals are using AI to make messages appear genuine. Training should be ongoing because the threats are constantly evolving. Build a new security framework And finally deploying new tools and training programs is all well and good but given the severity of the latest intelligence-powered threats organizations need to create strategies to help bolster security throughout the enterprise and be sure that policies are being enforced. This effort needs to be led by CISOs and strongly supported by other members of the C-suite. Executives should adopt a comprehensive framework that guides the implementation of suitable controls for the use of AI across the enterprise and within various business functions Kappel said. This includes interactions with third-party entities. The framework should include risk indicators the AI ecosystem and regulations and should address the unique security considerations associated with AI within their organizations and reducing their AI security risk he said. watch now VIDEO 3:13 03:13 Dont assume you have better cyber defenses than bad actors Commvault says Street Signs Asia',\n",
       " 'headline: Heres the new default font for Microsoft Outlook and Word: Aptos.  content: Goodbye Calibri. Microsoft has named the next default font for its productivity applications such as Word and Outlook after testing five candidates it introduced in 2021. Since then its been called Bierstadt. Now its getting a new name: Aptos. The move amounts to a subtle refinement for some of the most popular software in the world. Microsoft doesnt take such steps lightly because its Office products fetch almost 24% of its revenue. Theyre growing faster than other parts of the business such as video game content and search advertising as Microsoft seeks to line up more end users and get existing clients to spend more. If the core applications look fresh Microsoft can make a better argument when the time comes to renew subscriptions to Microsoft 365 formerly known as Office 365. The company is now ready to do that after accepting input from end users about the five new fonts. Today we begin the final phase of this major change where Aptos will start appearing as the new default font across Word Outlook PowerPoint and Excel for hundreds of millions of users Si Daniels principal program manager for Office design at Microsoft wrote in a blog post published Thursday. And over the next few months it will roll out to be the default for all our customers. Aptos will remain available in the font list under the old Bierstadt name for people who are accustomed to it. Users can also choose to set any other font as the default. That includes older standards such as Times New Roman Arial or even Calibri which has been the default since 2007 before the launch of Office 365 in 2011. Many people perceive Microsoft as a friendlier place since Satya Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer as its CEO in 2014 but that updated identity isnt necessarily reflected when someone starts writing an email in Outlook with a font that predates Nadella. In 2019 Microsoft asked font designer Steve Matteson to develop a font in the grotesque sans-serif style that includes the classic Helvetica. The company didnt let on that it was considering it as a possible successor for Calibri Matteson said in an interview with CNBC this week. At the time Matteson was still working for the font company Monotype and he and his colleagues gave Microsoft four or five proposals to look at without including the names of the contributors. Thats important because the designers didnt want his connection to Microsoft to influence the software makers decision he said. Mattesons work with Microsoft goes back to the 1990s. He helped with Microsofts TrueType fonts for Windows 3.1 and created the Segoe font Microsoft uses for its current logo and marketing materials. He also contributed to the aptly named font Curlz . That was not his proudest moment he said. Of the bunch that Matteson and his colleagues sent to Microsoft they picked his which at that point was dubbed simply Grotesque No. 2. Then Microsoft gave it a codename Koyuk. Then he came up with the name Bierstadt taking the name of a mountain in Colorado where he lives. In German Bierstadt means beer city. Some people didnt take the name seriously and Microsoft decided to come up with a new one for the font Matteson said. Aptos an unincorporated town in Santa Cruz County California came to his mind. Aptos has this unique coastal climate where its a beach and all the way up to the redwoods he said. Its what I loved about California is the diversity and it kind of told me that theres all these different moods and experiences you can have. Similarly with Aptos you have all these different voices you can speak in without distorting the message. Matteson came up with a serif version of the font along with a monospace version that can work for typing out code. Hes worked on monetary symbols and support for Greek and Cyrillic languages. He collaborated with Microsoft to ensure it will work well in different scenarios. If one were to convert cells in an Excel spreadsheet from Calibri to Aptos its unlikely that numbers in a cell will overflow into the one next to it he said. He hasnt seen every response to the font. But he has observed people saying that in Bierstadt a lowercase L and a capital I cant be mistaken for each other. Still Matteson has nothing but respect for Calibri and its creator Lucas de Groot. I can understand Microsoft wanting to you know make a change but I dont think theres ever been anything wrong with Calibri he said.

       " 'headline: AI could turn good jobs into bad jobs3 labor historians on what the future of work might hold.  content: The internet has been abuzz about the introduction of generative AI tools like ChatGPT which gained tens of millions of users within a matter of months after its fall 2022 release. Google and Microsoft are currently testing out their own generative AI tools as well. And people are nervous. More than a third 37% of adults are pessimistic about the future impact of AI on workers according to a recent Jobs for the Future survey of 2204 adults and 25% believe AI will hurt their industry. Changes in tech at work are nothing new. Technology transforming how we work is just a story of at least the past 200 years since the industrial revolution says Aaron Benanav  assistant professor of sociology at Syracuse University. What makes generative AI different at least in the way its been widely discussed is that it could affect traditional professional jobs like legal services financial services so higher paying jobs says Felix Koenig  assistant professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University. And perhaps those jobs have been perceived as immune . A recent analysis from the Pew Research Center found that jobs in which the most important tasks could be replaced or aided by AI tended to be in higher-paying fields where a college education and analytical skills can be a plus. History could help predict how generative AI might actually influence or change work in the future says Benanav. Heres what historians think could be in store for some roles. Tech could turn good jobs into bad jobs Generative AI could change the nature and parameters of certain jobs. Tools like ChatGPT could be used to take a complex role which one person was doing and break that one job into five jobs or 10 jobs or even like 50 jobs says Jason Resnikoff  assistant professor of contemporary history at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Each one of these jobs would then require less skill and expertise to ultimately complete the larger project. Resnikoff gives the example of what could happen to writers in the entertainment industry whove been on strike since May 2 in part because of stalled negotiations over the use of AI in their field. One option is well have an assembly line for a script for some TV show he says adding that AI would produce bad dialogue and then thered be the dialogue finisher. And then it would produce a bad premise and thered be the premise coordinator. Youd have many different writers jobs  none of them is writer. And each one of these jobs would theoretically take less skill and pay less than the current job of a writer. Another option is you make a two-tier system he says. The top tier would be a very thin layer of craft workers who are super well remunerated and they work in like a boutique shop Resnikoff says. Second-tier workers would have really s----- jobs and jobs that are extremely insecure. While the first-tier writers might work on every component of a script all the other TV is written by a machine and all these peons working at it he says. S----- jobs as Resnikoff describes them get at the core of the kind of job degradation this direction would result in. Historically breaking up larger roles requiring a lot of skill and expertise into a series of smaller ones has allowed employers to say youre doing so much less says Resnikoff so were going to pay you half of what you made before. Introducing new tech into the process has been a way to turn good jobs into bad jobs he says. One person could do a job historically done by many Another possible effect of this new tech is that some jobs will get eradicated altogether. Koenig gives the example of what happened after the introduction of talkies or films with sound in the 1920s. Up until that point movie theaters hired musicians that would play live music while the otherwise silent film was showing. There was actually a major union-driven drive that opposed the introduction of the talkies sound recorded movies he says. In part that was because there was fear that that would replace all these musicians. And while talkies didnt eradicate the need for a musician to make music that would be played during a film now you have one person that can play once and be listened to millions of times over he says. The musician still plays the piano as they would 100 years ago he says. But its just one person now that does the job that used to be done by hundreds of people. A recent analysis by Goldman Sachs found that globally 300 million jobs could be lost to generative AI. What typically happens is new jobs emerge Generative AI could also have some positive effects on the workplace. I think about academics having to write grants all the time says Benanav as an example. Those can be formulaic and would take far less time with the help of a machine. In programming its helping engineers write up basic outlines of code or sometimes like whole sections of code he says. Plus what typically happens is new jobs emerge that just didnt exist says Koenig about this kind of change. In fact new jobs have already emerged. Freelancer platform Fiverr has seen many new generative AI-oriented gigs pop up on their site since the onset of 2023 such as AI consultant and AI video editor . ZipRecruiter has also seen new full-time positions like creative director in AI and AI research scientist . The future is open Whatever changes are made in the workforce now and whatever the job market looks like down the line its important to remember that the real thing thats driving this is profit says Resnikoff. Companies are incentivized to prioritize their bottom line for a variety of reasons and sometimes that means driving down the cost of labor. The process that tech is usually promoting is like the machine is taking over right says Resnikoff. Thats the story that theyre telling. But ultimately its really the people in charge of their given workforces making the decision to create jobs that pay less or to cut jobs altogether. That being the case and with all of the different possibilities at play Benanav would remind workers that the future is open. The job could get better or worse he says and you should fight to try to create the conditions where its going to get better.

       " 'headline: How A.I. could change the future of work.  content: The recent rapid rise of accessible artificial intelligence tools has the potential to upend dozens of industries. Tools like Chat-GPT and Dall-E 2 by OpenAI can be used to create written content and visual outputs that in previous years required skilled workers who had years of training in art or writing. For myself as both an economist and an engineer Im absolutely shocked at the rate at which some of these generative content mechanisms are improving said J. Scott Marcus a senior fellow at Bruegel a Brussels-based think tank. Theres also been a long-standing debate whats the impact likely to be on the workforce A recent report by Goldman Sachs laid out some stark possibilities when it comes to AI and the economy. The report estimates two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. and Europe and around 300 million positions worldwide could be exposed to automation from new AI advances. The report also notes that one-fourth of all work being done could be replaced by generative AI.

       " 'headline: Google Cloud is partnering with Mayo Clinic as it tries to expand use of generative A.I. in health care.  content: Googles cloud business is expanding its use of new artificial intelligence technologies in health care giving medical professionals at Mayo Clinic the ability to quickly find patient information using the types of tools powering the latest chatbots. On Wednesday Google Cloud said Mayo Clinic is testing a new service called Enterprise Search on Generative AI App Builder which was introduced Tuesday. The tool effectively lets clients create their own chatbots using Googles technology to scour mounds of disparate internal data. In health care that means workers can interpret data such as a patients medical history imaging records genomics or labs more quickly and with a simple query even if the information is stored across different formats and locations. Mayo Clinic one of the top hospital systems in the U.S. with dozens of locations is an early adopter of the technology for Google which is trying to bolster the use of generative AI in the medical system. Mayo Clinic will test out different use cases for the search tool in the coming months and Vish Anantraman chief technology officer at Mayo Clinic said it has already been very fulfilling for helping clinicians with administrative tasks that often contribute to burnout. For instance if a physician needs to see information about a cohort of female patients aged 45 through 55 including their mammograms and medical charts they can enter that query into the search tool instead of seeking out each element separately. Similarly if a physician needs to know which clinical trials a patient may match they can search for that too. Its going to save a lot of time its going to prevent physician burnout its going to reduce administrative overload Anantraman told CNBC in an interview. Generative AI has been the hottest topic in tech since late 2022 when Microsoft -backed OpenAI released the chatbot ChatGPT to the public. Google raced to catch up rolling out its Bard AI chat service earlier this year and pushing to embed the underlying technology into as many products as possible. Health care is a particularly challenging industry because theres less room for incorrect answers or hallucinations  which occur when AI models fabricate information entirely. Aashima Gupta global director of health care strategy and solutions at Google Cloud said Google is taking a safety over speed approach with its Enterprise Search tool which is why the company has limited it to select early adopters like Mayo Clinic instead of rolling it out more broadly. We want to be very thoughtful and responsible in how we leverage such a powerful tool like generative AI in an enterprise setting especially in health care Gupta told CNBC in an interview. Google said its approach to privacy ensures customers retain control over their data and noted the new service is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Anantraman said Mayo Clinic has created safe sandboxes for workers to test applications of the technology and identify where it can be the most helpful. We take privacy of patient data very very seriously and our needs of our patients come first he said. Thats one of the reasons health care has to be very cautious in general as an industry in adopting technology that may not be fully tested may not be fully vetted. Google Cloud and Mayo Clinic signed a 10-year partnership in 2019. Mayo said at the time it selected Google Cloud to be the cornerstone of its digital transformation. The partnership announced Wednesday is the first step in an expanded agreement between the two companies to work together on AI applications in health care.

       " 'headline: IBM Consulting is using AI to maximize consultants productivity output. Heres how.  content: The consulting profession is all about human relationships. You listen to leaders help them define their core challenges and together you create a vision for the future: helping more customers and creating new and better products that advance society. Now generative AI can do more than ever in a much more accessible way including tasks previously considered only the domain of humans such as writing code rapidly summarizing ideas planning and analysis and even generating new business ideas. For the consulting profession like many others generative AI represents a massively disruptive force. This is an existential moment for consulting much like the rise of software-as-a-service was for the software industry. It has already begun to change the daily lives of consultants assisting them and freeing up time for their most important and strategic work  understanding and supporting clients transformation journeys. Here are three key insights IBM Consulting has found as we are transforming our own internal operations and client delivery with AI. AI can enhance knowledge and productivity AI can support consultants at every stage in a consulting engagement. It can help with strategy and design work project delivery and technology integration and running and operating a managed service. Today AI helps consultants quickly bring together a wealth of background information about their clients situation and challenges alongside industry data and similar challenges that others have faced. Imagine an IBM consultant with organizational memory at their fingertips  a knowledge base of trusted sources like benchmarking data across industries from the IBM Institute for Business Value and best practices and insights from tens of thousands of prior delivery projects. Once consultants have input from AI they can verify further analyze and refine that input to produce initial recommendations for the client that are sharper and grounded in data about what works. The first meeting with a client is not writing problem statements or design promptsits building on an already-created set of ideas and progressing faster into discussion decisions and co-creation. Generative AI can also help with important but time-consuming tasks like creating user personas in the design phase of a project. It can quickly generate personas based on existing user research data that consultants can use as a starting point and eventually refine. It can also provide ideas for draft proposals or reports that consultants can build upon disagree with and improve.  These two applications of AI not only support consultants creativity but also speed up progress for the client. AI is further useful in the later stages of a consulting project. For example AI can give consultants easy access to established corporate performance benchmarks around productivity gains or operational agility improvements that help them determine what to focus on next. By comparing current business performance to these benchmarks consultants and their clients can have better confidence about which work projects will offer the best returns. AI can even suggest initiatives to pursue such as specific improvements to customer service processes that benchmarks show can drive better results. Consultants can also leverage AI as an advisor in technology modernization such as helping with code generation to turn thousands of lines of COBOL programming language into Java. AI is a tool but human consultants are still central Most consultants would say that their favorite part of the work is people-facing  listening developing ideas together and building mutual trust. AI doesnt replace those foundational skills but makes them even more important than before. Consultants who are good at understanding their client and their needs bringing in diverse voices and perspectives and designing solutions that deliver value quickly will be able to refine these skills while leaning on AI for more manual and repetitive tasks. And because some of these tasks will continue after an engagement an AI-powered digital worker trained to work side-by-side with professionals can continue to add value for the client while allowing the human consultant to move to their next strategic problem. Transparency is essential As AI becomes more prevalent transparency is key to maintaining client trust. Clients expect to see the data sources AI uses to generate recommendations and want to know how bias is mitigated. They also expect transparency about how AI supports a consultants work output. Trust and transparency when applying technology is a core principle at IBM and is embedded in our methods like IBM Garage  our proven collaborative methodology to help clients fast-track value creation through innovation. We work with clients to define build and rapidly scale business transformation to quickly turn ideas into outcomes all while de-risking clients investments and tracking business value delivered in real time. This methodology also helps with change management so that users are more likely to buy in and adopt the solutions delivered. At IBM Consulting were transforming our own client delivery methods using IBM watsonx  our AI and data platform thats underpinned by governance tools to build trusted and transparent AI models as well as technology from our strategic partners.For example were building watsonx capabilities into IBM Garage to work smarter and faster on behalf of our clients. This is a new era of consulting in which the leaders will be separated by deeply human skills in building and sustaining trusted relationships complemented by AI to drive efficiency and help unleash human creativity.

       " 'headline: Why trust is critical to business applications of generative AI.  content: Trust has always been paramount to business success. Thats truer than ever before in the age of generative AI. Businesses need confidence that the mission-critical decisions and outputs generated by their AI solutions are trustworthy and reliable. They must consider if the AI is securely working only off their proprietary data address the related cybersecurity concerns and account for the environmental impact of training large language models (LLMs). They need to understand how their system reached a decision addressed compliance with business and regulatory requirements and mitigated biased or inflammatory behavior. The criticality of trust is even clearer today as generative AI is changing the landscape of whats possible with AI. For example generative AI models can produce highly believable well-structured responses so it can be hard to identify an incorrect response without the right subject matter expertise. Generative AI does not have test-retest reliability meaning you can ask the same question many times to an LLM and get different answers each time. It does not understand meaning which only exacerbates these risks. Many business leaders are feeling pressure from investors clients employees and others to accelerate their adoption of AI including generative AI but theyre weighing the urgency to act against the potential risks. In a recent IBM Institute for Business Value report titled  CEO decision-making in the age of AI  three-quarters of surveyed CEOs reported they believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI but 48% of CEOs surveyed worry about bias or data accuracy. IBM Consulting s experience helping clients in every industry and geography scale AI has shown us that building trust in AI in the enterprise requires a socio-technical approach that spans people process and technology. Fast Fact: Three-quarters of CEOs believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI but 48% worry about bias or data accuracy. Here are three actions leaders should consider to help drive trust as they scale AI: 1. Dont just publish your principles  operationalize them Fairness explainability privacy robustness and transparency are IBMs pillars for trustworthy AI . These are powerful and simple words to frame the functional and non-functional requirements for AI models but complicated to bring to life. For one example consider transparency. Users should be able to see how the AI service works evaluate its functionality and comprehend its strengths and limitations. This helps a user of the model determine whether it is appropriate for their situation. Transparency reinforces trust and the best way to promote transparency is through disclosure. Operationalizing that means ensuring AI systems share information on what data is collected how it will be used and stored and who has access to it. The systems should make their purposes clear to users. 2. Establish AI governance to embed the discipline of AI ethics Its easy to say that ethics matter but embedding those ethical principles into your operations requires governance. AI governance is how you define policies and establish accountability throughout the AI lifecycle. Its important to establish organizational structure policies process and monitoring. An AI Ethics Board can be a natural catalyst. At IBM we embed our Principles for Trust and Transparency across our company through an AI Ethics Board which provides centralized governance and holds our company and all IBMers accountable to our values. 3. Focus on culture and cross-functional collaboration The goal should be to have AI better reflect the communities that it serves. But making sure that systems of inequality arent perpetuated in AI requires establishing the right organizational culture to curate AI responsibly. The teams building AI tools and processes should represent multiple disciplines skillsets and lived experiences. Consider bringing in not only engineers and data scientists but designers legal professionals and the anticipated users themselves. Collaborative methods like the IBM Garage  are designed to help organizations with the framework to fast track innovation and drive meaningful lasting transformation that puts the user at the center and helps mitigate bias. Establishing systems that solicit continuous feedback on AI-driven tools and processes can also help drive better outcomes. All of these elements can help produce outcomes that garner trust from users. AI can be a powerful tool to fuel business transformation but successful implementation can depend on AI being used in a trustworthy and ethical manner. IBM Consulting is uniquely positioned to help businesses navigate this new era of AI applying AI at enterprise scale while following a human-centered principled approach that builds trust. The combination of our consulting capabilities in trustworthy AI and our powerful software like the AI and data platform IBM watsonx  can help businesses with auditing and mitigating risk implementing holistic governance frameworks operationalizing AI education and guidance and organizational change.

The latest update to the video platforms terms of service front-loads sections on software licensing beta services and compliance but if you read past that the fine print seems to reveal a key decision in Zooms AI strategy. The update effective as of July 27 establishes Zooms right to utilize some aspects of customer data for training and tuning its AI or machine-learning models. The service-generated data that Zoom can now use to train its AI includes customer information on product usage telemetry and diagnostic data and similar content or data collected by the company. It does not provide an opt-out option. This isnt an uncommon data category for companies to use for these purposes but the new terms are a measured step toward Zooms own AI ambitions. The update comes amid growing public debate on the extent to which AI services should be trained on individuals data no matter how aggregated or anonymized its said to be. Chatbots such as OpenAIs ChatGPT Googles Bard and Microsofts Bing along with image-generation tools like Midjourney and Stable Diffusion are trained on swaths of internet text or images. Across the generative AI sector lawsuits have popped up in recent months from authors or artists who say they see their own work reflected in AI tools outputs. You consent to Zooms access use collection creation modification distribution processing sharing maintenance and storage of Service Generated Data for any purpose to the extent and in the manner permitted under applicable Law including for the purpose of ... machine learning or artificial intelligence (including for the purposes of training and tuning of algorithms and models) Zooms terms state. Customer content such as messages files and documents do not seem to be included in this category. In a follow-up blog post  Zoom clarified that for AI we do not use audio video or chat content for training our models without customer consent. The key phrase is without customer consent. In June Zoom introduced two new generative AI features  a meeting summary tool and a tool for composing chat messages  on a free trial basis for customers who can decide whether or not to use them. But when a user does enable these features Zoom has them sign a consent form allowing Zoom to train its AI models using their individual customer content. Your content is used solely to improve the performance and accuracy of these AI services Zoom wrote in the blog post. A company spokesperson said in a statement that Zoom customers decide whether to enable generative AI features and separately whether to share customer content with Zoom for product improvement purposes.',\n",

It was a major point of contention in the recent writers and actors strikes  with the unions and studios clashing over guardrails for use of the technology. AI could be a particular sore spot for the people who make animated movies. Jeffrey Katzenberg the former Disney executive who co-founded DreamWorks recently said AI would dramatically reduce the labor required to make animated films. In the good old days when I made an animated movie it took 500 artists five years to make a world-class animated movie. I think it wont take 10% of that. Literally I dont think it will take 10% of that three years out from now Katzenberg said. The Animation Guild which represents professionals in the animation industry is taking the issue of AI seriously a representative for the union told CNBC. The guild established a task force earlier this year to investigate AI and machine learning and then provide recommendations to union membership. As for the Piaf biopic the guild noted that the project appears to be in accordance with newly established SAG-AFTRA guidelines to receive consent by an authorized representative of the deceased performer to use a digital replica of the performer. Warner Music said AI technology will be trained on hundreds of voice clips and images to revive the late singer for the 90-minute film set to take place in the Paris and New York between the 1920s and 1960s. The biopic will be narrated using Piafs AI regenerated voice while animation will provide a modern take on her story. So far only a proof of concept of the film has been created Warner Music said. The company said it will partner with a studio to produce the full-length film. Theres no release date yet either a Warner Music representative told CNBC. Its been a special and touching experience to be able to hear Ediths voice once again  the technology has made it feel like we were back in the room with her the executors of Piafs estate said in a release. The animation is beautiful and through this film well be able to show the real side of Edith. Piaf had previously been the subject of a 2007 film La Vie en Rose. Marion Cotillard who portrayed Piaf in the film won the Academy Award for best actress.',\n",
       " 'headline: What Is ChatGPT and How Does It Make Money.  content: ChatGPT the free chatbot released in November 2022 by artificial intelligence (AI) research company OpenAI has taken the internet by storm. In its first months of existence ChatGPT inspired users to imagine a host of use cases for the model including using ChatGPT to negotiate parking tickets make workout plans and even create bedtime stories for children. Some artificial intelligence experts believe that ChatGPT could revolutionize both the way that humans interact with chatbots and AI more broadly. Below we explore this new technology and how it is poised to begin making money. What Is ChatGPT Put simply ChatGPT is an AI model that engages in conversational dialogue. It is an example of a chatbot  akin to the automated chat services found on some companies customer service websites. It was developed by OpenAI a tech research company dedicated to ensuring that artificial intelligence benefits all of humanity. The GPT in ChatGPT refers to Generative Pre-training Transformer referring to the way that ChatGPT processes language. What sets ChatGPT apart from chatbots over the last several decades however is that ChatGPT was trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). RLHF involves the use of human AI trainers and reward models to develop ChatGPT into a bot capable of challenging incorrect assumptions answering follow-up questions and admitting mistakes. To put ChatGPT to the test Investopedia asked it to write a journalistic-style article explaining what ChatGPT is. The bot responded that it was designed to generate human-like text based on a given prompt or conversation. It added that because it is trained on a data set of human conversations it can understand context and intent and is able to have more natural intuitive conversations. In its response to our prompt ChatGPT said that its applications could include customer service bots creation of content for social media or blogs and translation of text from one language to another. How Does ChatGPT Make Money OpenAI the company that created ChatGPT has not yet monetized ChatGPT on a wide scale. A free version of ChatGPT remains available on OpenAIs website as of Feb. 23 2023. However the company does sell the application programming interface on a subscription basis to organizations looking to use the model for their own purposes according to Investopedias query to ChatGPT itself. On Feb. 1 2023 OpenAI announced that it would launch a pilot version of a paid subscription plan called ChatGPT Plus for $20 per month. Subscribers will receive benefits including access to ChatGPT during peak times faster response times and priority access for new improvements and features. The company said this paid plan is available in the U.S. and that users will be invited from a waitlist over the coming weeks. OpenAI will expand access to additional parts of the world over time. The viral success of ChatGPT could be worth a huge amount to OpenAI which was co-founded by Elon Musk . Within a week of its launch the model had gained one million users. And two months after ChatGPT was released OpenAI raised the possibility of selling existing shares in a tender offer that would place the value of the company at about $29 billion  making it among the most valuable startups . Benefits of ChatGPT As mentioned there are numerous potential uses for ChatGPT. They range from more direct chatbot-type functions to much more obscure applications and it is likely that users will explore a host of other possible ways to utilize this technology in the future including in search engines. While chatbots have existed for many years ChatGPT is viewed as a significant improvement on the intelligibility fluidity and thoroughness of prior models. One demonstration of the sophistication of ChatGPT provided by OpenAI includes a prompt that was designed to trick the bot: asking about when Christopher Columbus (supposedly) came to the United States in 2015. ChatGPTs response easily avoided the trap clarifying that while Columbus did not come to the U.S. in 2015 it can posit some of the ways he may have reacted to his visit if he had. Disadvantages of ChatGPT OpenAI lists some of the limitations of ChatGPT as it currently exists in its presentation of the model. These include that ChatGPT sometimes writes coherent but incorrect statements that it makes assumptions about ambiguous queries and that the model tends to be excessively verbose among similar concerns. In the first weeks of its public release ChatGPT made headlines for its alleged use among students in creating AI-written papers and assignments. Concerns about the misuse of ChatGPT for academic cheating grew large enough that a computer science student at Princeton University created an app designed to identify and expose writing created by the bot. For some ChatGPT poses additional and more serious risks. For instance some analysts have predicted that the bot could be used to make malware and phishing attacks more sophisticated or that hackers may utilize the technology to develop their own AI models that may be less well-controlled. As concerns about misinformation have proliferated some are especially sensitive to the possibility that ChatGPT could be used to create and share convincing but misleading material of a political nature. Recent Developments In January 2023 Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ) announced it would invest $10 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The tech giant could use the technology undergirding ChatGPT to allow other companies to create their own customized chatbots. ChatGPT could also help to revitalize Microsofts Bing search engine. Tech companies are focused on the use of ChatGPT and similar advanced chatbots as a replacement for traditional search models with one vision for the future of chatbots holding that they will be able to provide a single definitive response to a search prompt rather than a large list of links to websites. Microsofts move toward ChatGPT-based search is one threat to Alphabet Inc.s ( GOOG ) $149-billion Google search engine. Alphabet executives have reportedly responded to news of ChatGPT and its potential to upend the process of searching for information online by issuing a code red and redirecting resources toward AI development. Google is expected to unveil close to two dozen new AI-based products in 2023. Google is also launching its own chatbot to directly rival ChatGPT. Called Bard the companys chatbot utilizes its preexisting large language model Lamda. Microsoft has moved quickly to begin integrating ChatGPT into its offerings. On Feb. 1 the company announced a premium version of its Teams service that is powered by the chatbot. The service will be available for $7 per month in June and for $10 per month starting in July. The upgraded version of Teams will use ChatGPT to generate meeting notes create templates and recommend tasks. What is ChatGPT ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot designed to provide natural fluid dialogue-like responses to queries. What Makes ChatGPT Stand Out ChatGPTs functionality including its ability to understand context and detail and to recognize when it has made mistakes is seen as standing out among rivals. What Are Potential Uses of ChatGPT There are a host of ways that ChatGPT could potentially be used including enhancing search engine functionality automating processes like disputing traffic tickets or bills and creating code among many other applications. ChatGPT has also raised concerns about its potential misuse by malicious actors. Hackers could utilize the bot to create convincing malware or phishing scams and the model could be tasked with creating and spreading misinformation. The Bottom Line ChatGPT is a powerful AI bot that engages in human-like dialogue based on a prompt. It is designed to respond in a natural intuitive way and has numerous potential uses. The bot gained viral attention shortly after its release in November 2022 and achieved 1 million users within a few days. However there are concerns about the potential misuse of the bot by hackers spreaders of misinformation and other bad actors. OpenAI the maker of ChatGPT has announced a paid subscription plan for a premium version of the chatbot and is considering a tender offer to value the company at $29 billion.',\n",

The news comes days after Baidu revealed a slew of AI-powered applications on Tuesday in the wake of more supportive regulation. Tencent has said it was internally testing its Hunyuan AI model on advertising and fintech. The gaming and social media giant is also set to release an AI chatbot on Thursday the company said in an online post . Tencent is integrating Hunyuans capabilities with its existing products for video conferencing and social media Tong told CNBC. The company operates WeChat a widely used messaging and payments app in China and video conference platform Tencent Meeting. Baidu and several other Chinese companies received the green light in the last few weeks to release AI-powered chatbots to the public. Similar to ChatGPT the bots purport to respond to queries in a human-like conversational fashion  but primarily in Chinese. Some such as Baidus Ernie bot also convert text to images and video  with the help of plugins. OpenAIs ChatGPT isnt officially available in China. The chatbot releases follow new Chinese regulation on generative AI that took effect Aug. 15. When asked about the rules Tong pointed out that such artificial intelligence is so new that no one knows what impact it will have on society. watch now VIDEO 4:13 04:13 A Huawei 7nm chip will likely impact Apples sales in China says Cowens Krish Sankar Squawk on the Street Its prudent to put in some guardrails in place he said. That will help make sure the technology or the services being offered are of high enough quality so they dont create and distribute false information he said. Chinese authorities said the interim rules that took effect last month would not apply to companies developing the AI tech as long as the product was not available to the mass public. Thats more relaxed than a draft released in April that said forthcoming rules would apply even at the research stage. Development constraints While Beijing has shown it is more supportive of generative AI than initially feared Chinese companies also face U.S. restrictions on obtaining advanced semiconductors . The most cutting edge versions of the high-tech chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs) allow companies to train AI models. The constraint that were facing will hinder the progress the speed of development Tong told CNBC in response to a question about U.S. restrictions. watch now VIDEO 8:16 08:16 Can Chinas ChatGPT clones give it an edge over the U.S. in an A.I. arms race International Digital Originals He noted demand for computing power overall far exceeds supply in China. To mitigate the shortage he said companies are focusing on specific use cases building models of the appropriate size. And we are hoping that the supply of the GPU compute will be larger in the coming months and therefore the development of these technologies can get faster. AI for business Tencent is just one of many companies in China  ranging from startups to phone maker Huawei  that have rushed to announce AI products this year. In August Alibaba announced it was opening its own AI model to third-party developers . Artificial intelligence requires industry-specific training for the technology to generate value Tencents Tong said. He listed business use cases in tourism finance public services and customer service.

       " 'headline: With A.I. top CFOs are more likely to see it as a job destroyer.  content: watch now VIDEO 1:10 01:10 Business leaders remain cautious when it comes to A.I. survey finds Squawk Box While there is no debate that artificial intelligence is going to have a significant impact on work and how it is done in the future there isnt consensus on whether AI will be a net job creator or destroyer  helping workers to do their jobs better creating better jobs for humans to do or simply replacing a significant percentage of the workforce. Workers are worried but notably the fears are nowhere near the majority view. About one-quarter (24%) have concerns that AI will make their job obsolete  with workers of color younger workers and lower-salaried workers more concerned according to a CNBC/SurveyMonkey Workforce Survey done in May. Inside the C-suite at major corporations where decisions will be made about AI implementation and return on investment there is another notable split: top finance executives are more likely than top technology executives to see AI as a job destroyer. Almost half (41%) of respondents to the latest quarterly survey of the CNBC CFO Council say they believe AI will destroy more jobs than it creates. An equal percentage say its too soon to tell. But given the choice of potential futures just 18% of CFOs say they see AI as a job creator. That is in contrast to the nearly half (47%) of senior tech officials responding to a recent CNBC Technology Executive Council survey who said they think AI technologies will create more jobs than they destroy. There are tech executives who take a less rosy view: 26% said AI will destroy more jobs than it creates while an equal 26% said it is too soon to know. But given the same choice as CFOs making the financial and cost decisions for companies tech executives are the ones more likely to have an optimistic view. CFOs are by nature cautious and this shows up in the pace at which the executives see their companies investing in AI as well. More than 40% of CFOs surveyed said that while their companies are evaluating new investments in AI amid its boom they are being cautious with 32% responding that their investments are accelerating. Another 18% said their firms are planning no new AI investments. For tech executives AI is the clear priority. Nearly half of TEC members surveyed by CNBC said that AI is their top priority for tech spending over the next year and AI budgets are more than double the second-biggest spending area in tech cloud computing at 21%. Matt Higgins CEO of private investment firm RSE Ventures told CNBCs Last Call on Thursday that CFOs are making a mistake. My first reaction was one of horror Higgins said of the 18% of CFO respondents who said their firms are planning no new AI investments. Im glad it is anonymous because they are going to regret it one day he said. watch now VIDEO 3:20 03:20 A.I. will create a whole new class of entrepreneurs says RSEs Matt Higgins Last Call The CFOs should be an early adopter of AI because thats the low-hanging fruit Higgins said. You can go on Twitter right now and find 20 different tools that can potentially making someones job easier potentially take something that had been outsourced and bring it in-house. ... The CFO should be the one sending the annoying email to the CEO he said. Higgins said any top executive who indicates that their firm is planning no new AI investments is reflecting an ignorance that remains widespread in the U.S. corporate sector about what is taking place. He cited a recent PwC survey that shows only 25% of companies in the U.S. say they are deploying AI while in China that same figure is at 58%. A war is already underway that most people dont realize has started he said. Mark McDonald senior director analyst in Gartners finance practice said that within the finance function specifically he sees an opportunity for automation of many tasks. The automation of processes like validating numbers and checking data will allow people in finance roles to focus on analyzing and responding to data. This is a potential outcome that reflects belief among many AI leaders that AI will take over tasks that do not maximize human potential and allow workers to focus on higher order tasks. McDonald who focuses on the application and impact of AI and machine learning technologies said this approach could be leveraged further across companies providing opportunities where AI creates more jobs or at least enhances them but also makes some lower-paying jobs less necessary. But he added that from a CFO and finance perspective there is no shortage of work. We are at the beginning of this era and AI is still not being leveraged in the workplace far from it he said. McDonald is still in the to-be-determined camp when it comes to AI as a net job creator or destroyer. Any disruptive technology of which AI certainly is one youre going to see shifts in jobs  some jobs will go away other jobs will be created he said. A definition answer on the jobs questions will take time to materialize and a wait-and-see approach may be the right one. Moodys Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi recently told CNBC that concerns that AI will lead to workers losing their jobs when companies see cost saving opportunities may be premature. If history is a guide and we look at other game-changing technologies it does take time for those technologies to be incorporated into business practices Zandi said. Generally it happens over periods of several years even a couple of decades. Zandi added that the implementation of AI might help workers garner larger salaries as overall productivity may increase. We are just at the first step of whats going to be a long long transition McDonald said. I heard this elsewhere and I agree with it this is industry 3.0 or 4.0 and this is going to change how we do things how we think about things and how we solve problems.',\n",

These tools can help you get ahead in your career according to Sarah Hoffman VP of AI and machine learning research at Fidelity Investments. Shes a particular fan of using ChatGPT OpenAIs popular generative AI chatbot in a professional context. The people who figure out how [to] use this tool to be better at my job and do things differently than I did before are the ones that are really going to succeed Hoffman said recently at the Fast Company Innovation Festival 2023. If you become proficient at using ChatGPT  a version of which is free to use for anyone with an OpenAI account  you can make yourself more efficient creative and knowledgeable Hoffman said. Heres how. Improve your productivity and efficiency Whether youre drafting a report creating a PowerPoint presentation or writing software code generative AI can help you just speed up the process Hoffman said. If you ask ChatGPT to write me a template for a presentation about fashion merchandising the tool will create a detailed outline for you in seconds. Now your job isnt to write a presentation from scratch. Its to edit and proofread a template that already exists. This is particularly useful for anyone who struggles with blank page syndrome  staring at a white piece of paper or screen for hours on end. It may be less useful for someone who lacks attention to detail  because you really do need to double-check or even triple-check the chatbots work. When asked a series of 512 software engineering questions ChatGPT got 52% of the answers incorrect an August 2023 study from Purdue University found. Seventy-seven percent of those answers were long-winded further showing the need for human input. You might need a human in the loop in many cases because this technology [can] make things up  so you might want someone to verify it said Hoffman. Get better at brainstorming Hoffman likes to use ChatGPT as a brainstorming partner she said. In this context the tools mistakes and fabrications dont really matter  youre only using it for inspiration. I dont mind if it makes something up [while Im] brainstorming Hoffman said. Im not using it as a research [or] factual tool. In a recent test Make It asked ChatGPT: Whats a creative way for me to teach a lesson to my class Incorporate hands-on activities or simulations that actively engage your students the chatbot responded. For example you could use role-playing exercises interactive games or real-world case studies relevant to your subject. ChatGPT also recommended using videos animations and interactive online tools to make the learning experience more dynamic. Most teachers are probably already familiar with many of those strategies but the point isnt to learn something you dont know. Youre establishing a jumping-off point for orienting your brain in the right direction said Hoffman. Ask dumb questions without fear or judgment Sixty-two percent of students report feeling discouraged from asking questions in class because they worry others will judge them a 2020 study from the University of Central Florida found. The same phenomenon occurs in workplaces said Hoffman. If I have a question I might ask a coworker ... Hey can you explain this topic to me If I still dont understand it I probably will not ask a second time Hoffman said. But I will go into a generative AI tool and say I still dont understand. Can you explain it to me as a college student Can you explain it to me as a fourth grader Can you use a metaphor In this context you definitely need to verify that any information generated is factually accurate. Depending on your query the consequences could be dire. Still using AI can at least help you alleviate some anxiety around asking your boss or professor questions. Theres no judgment with AI said Hoffman. You cant say the same for humans. And that makes it really really powerful.

       " 'headline: On-the-job generative AI training is already critical for workers. Heres how to get started.  content: For those concerned about workers having solid generative AI skills theres one way to take control: on-the-job training. Your job will not be replaced by AI. Your job will be replaced by someone else who uses AI if you dont said John Blackmon chief AI officer of custom training organization ELB Learning which has products used by companies like Google  Mastercard and GM to upskill their workforces. The difference between proficiency and expertise Blackmon said lies in understanding whats going on behind the scenes. Much like the intricacies of telephone or internet communications its the programmers and engineers who need to be true experts on generative AI. For the general workforce Blackmon said the key is knowing how to prompt platforms to produce the outputs you need. Prompting is the new way to speak Blackmon said. Its organizations that have a sizable stake in employees becoming comfortable producing generative AI inputs. Training is essential because employees are going to use generative AI regardless of whether their leaders enable them to do so responsibly and efficiently. Any new employee today is already showing up with ChatGPT in their back pocket said Bryan Kirschner vice president of strategy at DataStax a vector database solution for generative AI applications. What do they get when they sit down at their desk or at their remote workstation at home According to a recent AI skills report from TalentLMS  58% of HR managers will use upskilling and reskilling initiatives to overcome the AI-induced skills gap. Here are some of the key concepts in that effort. Crawl walk and then run with AI The path to training said Kirschner is thinking about crawl walk run. But crawl really soon. Kirschner said no generative AI walks alone. Much like you wouldnt have an employee without a manager or coach you wouldnt have generative AI without a copilot. Whereas employees may be nave about the use of generative AI in the beginning they have the capacity to become ingenious through training. Kirschner said it is important for employees to get to a place where they have points of view and are able to be creative in thinking about how to apply generative AI use cases to customer needs. Kirschners team at DataStax produced an AI maturity model that measures the sophistication of a companys AI usage. There are four main threads in the model: context culture architecture and trust. The model includes an arc that showcases the best ways to implement generative AI from the beginning until workers feel savvy. For example the context thread of the maturity model begins with privacy by design and works up to continuous learning and real-time adaptation. Meanwhile the culture thread starts with a values-driven organization and works up to variable compensation that rewards ethical decisions and regulator engagement. For architecture automated code generation and testing inform sophistication. Trust includes factors like internal and external transparency. Adopt AI responsibly and slowly Blackmon said upskilling for generative AI is similar to other types of training. You have to have clear goals he said. You have to know exactly what youre trying to do. You have to know the audience that youre talking to. Internal working groups help many companies inform approved generative AI use cases and help employees responsibly navigate the process of training and adoption. Typically stakeholders from different corners of the organization will be present to create a well-rounded approach. Hasnain Malik HR director at Brainchild Communications said that companies should choose a small group of users and target a narrow set of functionality. Expand the trial incrementally until youre comfortable rolling it out to everyone Malik said. Data security software company BigID published a course How to Accelerate AI Initiatives  that shared what organizations need to do to adopt AI responsibly from governing large language models to prevent data leaks to avoiding non-compliance and reducing risks associated with employing generative AI usage. This includes classifying all data that goes into an LLM  If its junk going in its junk going out Blackmon said unique company data sets. The BigID course suggests setting automatic flags for policy violations when sensitive or regulated data ends up in the wrong place. These can include existing policies but should also include new policies that manage and monitor potential risks specifically associated with generative AI (as long as those policies dont contradict any existing ones). Carrie Hoffman partner and labor and employment attorney with Foley  Lardner said that generative AI policies dont exist in a vacuum. Everything you do from an AI perspective needs to be done in conjunction with making sure were still being compliant Hoffman said. Shabbi Khan a patent attorney at Foley  Lardner said theres a balance between being permissive and monitoring activities connected to AI. If youre too strict employees may end up using it on their personal devices Khan said. Additionally a concise best practices guide ensures employees actually read what youre asking of them such as having your employees turn off training mode and avoiding inputting confidential information. Keeping a guard up around AI As part of training its crucial to remind all generative AI users to keep their guard up and confirm the accuracy of outputs. Hallucinations or seemingly made-up outputs unverified by the models data set are real  even if rare. As these models are getting better and better the hallucinations are harder to detect Khan said. People will start assuming that the outputs are accurate because you dont find as many mistakes. This is called automation bias where theres an assumption the machine is right but its still just as important to retain critical oversight. Kirschner who has been in the tech strategy game for multiple revolutions said We used to say in the early days of mobile its becoming the front door to your business and I think generative AI will become the front door to your business. With that in mind it only makes sense to provide upskilling that enables your people to power the organization in a world that looks different than it did yesterday. watch now VIDEO 26:28 26:28 Straight Talk About AI and the Workforce Workforce Wire',\n",
       " 'headline: AI startups bringing dollars but lean workforces to ailing San Francisco.  content: Some tech professionals think that in time AI will still buoy the citys economy even if it scripts a different destiny from the previous tech boom. In a frenzy unseen since the birth of social media in the early 2000s investors are pouring billions into generative AI and fueling a startup boom in San Francisco. At the same time they are fueling hopes that the nascent AI sector will help revive the citys decaying downtown after the pandemic. But the rapid growth of the artificial-intelligence business may not be a panacea for the citys economic and commercial real-estate woes according to a dozen tech industry professionals interviewed by Reuters. Unlike past tech booms that have touched San Francisco the generative AI craze brings fewer jobs because AI firms excel at staying lean and automating work. I think we should curb our optimism that San Francisco commercial real estate will bounce back because of AI said Silicon Valley investor Jeremiah Owyang. The mentality of AI startups is AI-first. So you get AI to do the job before humans do it. Eleven of the countrys top 20 AI companies are in San Francisco and have raised $15.7 billion collectively between 2008 and 2023. However they employ a total of only 3400 people in the city according to an analysis from San Francisco Mayor London Breeds office which used data from venture capital firm NFX. That amount is just 2.3% of the estimated 150000 daily workers that downtown San Francisco lost during the pandemic. Office workers accounted for nearly three-quarters of the citys gross domestic product before COVID-19 hit. Generative AI which learns from past data to create brand new content is seen as a game-changer for workplace efficiency especially for software engineers the bread and butter of San Franciscos tech workforce. AI has already reshaped their work: according to research from popular code hosting platform GitHub 92% of software developers use AI and developers that used GitHubs coding assistant were able to complete a coding task 55% faster. These (AI) companies almost certainly wont have thousands of employees and corporate cafeterias like Airbnb or Dropbox said Erin Price-Wright a partner at San Francisco-based Index Ventures. Airbnb and Dropbox both based in San Francisco employ about 10000 people combined. In contrast Microsoft-backed OpenAI which developed the smash-hit ChatGPT chatbot has raised over $11 billion in eight years and has around 500 employees according to the company. Headquartered in the citys hipster Mission district the company uses AI to help solve its problems. For instance when faced with a deluge of support tickets OpenAI chose to train its own AI to help its staff answer these tickets more efficiently according to an OpenAI employee with direct knowledge of the project. A spokesperson for OpenAI said the company uses its products to help with its work but is also actively recruiting including in customer support. We are getting to the point where AI can function as a real employee said Matt Schlicht CEO of Octane AI which tailors online shopping to a persons needs. Within your lifetime you will likely see a one-person team start a billion-dollar company. THREE AI EVENTS PER DAY San Francisco even as it battles societal issues like drugs homelessness and unaffordable housing has gained a reputation as the AI capital of the world as the citys mayor recently called it. For instance Dubai-based entrepreneur Mike Grabowski told Reuters that in June he saw a tweet from Owyang the Silicon Valley investor which said In SF there are 44 AI events in two weeks about three a day. Grabowski who has started a company that uses AI to write content for social media influencers hopped on a flight to San Francisco on the same day. Two days later jetlagged but optimistic about meeting prospective investors he went to an AI event hosted by Owyang who said he received 560 applications to attend the meetup. The excitement about AI is palpable at tech events in the city reminiscent of the decade before the pandemic when companies like Alphabets Google opened offices and startups colonized more industrial parts of town. The City by the Bay became a tech hub coinciding with an eight-year tax break dubbed the Twitter tax break aimed at encouraging tech companies to relocate there. Recently though San Franciscos problems have made headlines. Office buildings are over 30% vacant according to real estate firm CBRE as people continue to work from home venture capital firms choose calmer parts of town and many large tech firms have slashed workforces. Ridership on the BART rapid-transit system in downtown San Francisco is still at one-third of pre-pandemic levels according to city government data. As the crises of drugs and homelessness have spiraled tourists and business visitors have stayed away pushing some hotels to the brink of default. Dismal foot traffic has prompted companies including Nordstrom to shut their downtown stores. Some tech professionals think that in time AI will still buoy the citys economy even if it scripts a different destiny from the previous tech boom. Since AI makes it easier to run a company there will be more small firms hiring dozens of people as opposed to a few big tech companies that previously hired thousands said Lee Edwards a technology investor at San Francisco-based Root VC. Others think it will be more of the same and that rewards from the technology will go to fewer people exacerbating the inequality that already plagues Californias third-largest city. Generative AI is even more concentrated than previous waves of digital technologies and a handful of companies are going to be at the forefront said Daron Acemoglu an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies how technology affects inequality. Top executives and their upper cadre of engineers programmers managers are going to benefit a lot more.',\n",

The project is being overseen by founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu and is being worked on by the companys RD team in India. We have been working on artificial intelligence for a decade now. When customers needed ChatGPT integration we gave them that by integration with 13 of our apps as we announced recently Praval Singh vice president of marketing and customer experience Zoho said in Delhi on June 14.

But we are also building proprietary large language models that will be capable of summarising paraphrasing and adapting to new tasks. However we have not set a specific timeline for it he added. Zohos announcement of building LLMs comes days after a controversy was stirred up around a comment made by OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman. He said that it would be hopeless for an Indian startup with $10 million in funding to work on a foundational LLM. Altman later clarified that his quote had been taken out of context but not before Tech Mahindra CEO CP Gurnani declared that he took OpenAI chiefs remark as a challenge. Meanwhile Union Minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar has said that OpenAI chief Sam Altman is not the final word on Indias AI aspirations and that there will be many areas where he disagrees with the founder of the immensely popular ChatGPT chatbot.',\n",

As public market tech giants jockey for leading positions in advanced AI well-funded open source startups are eyeing expansion as competition intensifies and more enterprises consider adding open models and providers to their generative AI push. The drama over OpenAI reinforces the need for open source or community models outside a single company said Mike Gualtieri vice president and principal analyst at market research firm Forrester. OpenAI staff threats to quit  and worries about the startups ability to continue to function and support the hundreds of startups that had rushed into its ecosystem highlighted how quickly a competitive landscape can shift and in unexpected ways. In addition to an offer from Microsoft to join at current compensation Salesforce CEO and co-founder Marc Benioff offered jobs to any OpenAI talent thinking of departing the company. What we want to avoid is only one game in town a large monopoly operating behind closed doors. This OpenAI saga demonstrates that the ecosystem is too fragile to rely on a single company for its AI needs said Delip Rao an AI research scientist and academic who has worked at Twitter and Google. We should encourage all companies to build on disruption-proof AI technology that only open source can offer. To be clear big bets made on open source AI pre-date last Friday when news first broke of Sam Altmans removal as OpenAI CEO and those bets include an open source AI model controlled by one dominant tech company  Meta Platforms  Llama. Salesforce-invested Hugging Face  named after the popular smiley emoji with a matching logo is gearing up after a $235 million venture deal at a $4.5 billion valuation in August. The French-American open source AI company has raised a total $400 million from a broad array of 30 tech investors including Qualcomm IBM  Google  Nvidia Intel and Sequoia Capital. We are not following the Silicon Valley playbook said Thomas Wolf co-founder and CEO of Hugging Face a central hub connecting developers and researchers to share code and build AI tools together in an interview that was conducted before the recent OpenAI shakeup. AI builders are growing superfast raising and burning money. We are not in that mindset. Weve been around for seven years and didnt need to raise money. We can make plans for the long run without a problem. Wolf stressed his firms contrast to enterprise-controlled and owned software models. We are unlocking the community to develop AI to share and build together he said. And in a subsequent interview after the OpenAI power struggle began he referenced the Linux open operating system a widely used rival to Microsofts Windows which he said was never at risk of disappearing because Linus Torvalds (its creator) changed jobs. Hugging Face has 160 employees and turned cash flow positive early last year he said and may make an acquisition after buying machine learning startup Gradio in 2021. I dont see the market consolidating. Instead it will fan out. This past June Salesforce Ventures the companys investment arm doubled its generative AI fund to $500 million. We are excited about innovations in generative AI in an open way so researchers and developers can collaborate said Paul Drews managing partner at Salesforce Ventures. Competitive leverage is top of mind. Salesforce could partner with Hugging Face in the future and is in the early days of exploring collaboration he said.

Heres whos on the new OpenAI board and whos out After closed door OpenAI drama open source AI could emerge winner Nvidias revenue triples as AI chip boom continues Open source and AI governance Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt is behind Mistral AI another open source rival to OpenAIs ChatGPT. Founded in France by alums of Alphabet s Deep Mind and Meta the startup launched in May and within four weeks picked up $113 million from Lightspeed Venture Partners with other Silicon Valley heavyweights and several French investors. Mistral AI is raising more funding reportedly at least $400 million at a $1 billion valuation. Open-source development is the only validated way of making software collaboratively and AI is no different. Governance matters said Arthur Mensch CEO and co-founder Mistral AI in an interview after the OpenAI news. This November Microsoft began offering the startups service on its Azure cloud computing platform. A third open source AI startup Poolside AI recently pulled in $126 million co-led by French telecom and internet billionaire Xavier Niel and U.S. VC firm Felicis Ventures. Between Hugging Face Mistral and Poolside France  which is making a coordinated government-industry push to be a global AI leader  had three of the top AI startup funding deals in Europe this year. Schmidt is leading the development of a Silicon Valley-like hub for AI research and innovation in the country. Meanwhile this November in China AI investor and former Google president Kai-Fu Lee launched his own contender 01.AI funded by his firm Sinovation Ventures and Alibaba . Elon Musk is charging forward with OpenAI rival xAI  which can access data on X and is currently being tested with a select number of users. Beginning as a chatbot Hugging Face pivoted to natural language processing (NLP) models and then built its open source platform for data science and machine learning. Today Hugging Face counts more than 2 million users 400000 models and 77000 data sets. Most or 90 percent of its services are offered for free while paid projects bring in revenue (undisclosed). Among its customers are IBM and AWS which use its tools to integrate into their offerings for clients. Joint efforts can accelerate innovation and the development of on-device AI applications said Quinn Li senior vice president and global head at Qualcomm Ventures of its recent co-investment in Hugging Face. Its pretty clear now that AI is changing the world. We are at the beginning of what AI can tackle Wolf said noting its ability to create music text and images and possibly film. We are covering the whole spectrum of Gen AI. Risks and opportunities in open source AI models Venture capitalist Bill Gurley of Benchmark along with a group of 17 investors and founders submitted a letter to President Biden this month regarding the recent AI Executive Order  noting its potential for restricting open source. They spelled out the importance of open source AI in fostering innovation encouraging competition and democratizing access to technology and noted that this community approach to building is what made the Internet successful. With open source developers can collaborate and share knowledge resulting in more rapid innovation said AOL co-founder Steve Case chairman and CEO of Washington D.C.-based investment firm Revolution who recently penned an op-ed for CNBC including this among his keys for strong U.S. AI innovation policy. Having open source AI allows startups to compete with big tech companies. It levels the playing field so that all companies and developers have access to the same tools he said. While open models are regarded as a fast transparent and accountable way to innovate on the flip side they can be viewed as not as safe as proprietary ones because the source code is public which may invite bad actors. Open source will reduce some fears namely by offering transparency and creating more trust and confidence Case said but he added we cannot minimize the risks that could come along with AI and certainly some of those risks are heightened with an open source system. An issue in the forefront for these startups that partner with technology giants is whether they can remain neutral in developing open source technology for the community. If startups get a lot of investment from a tech giant can they remain neutral asked Forrester analyst Gualtieri. It is very hard to remain neutral when taking money from strategic investors including Salesforce and Nvidia. This is a clever balance that Hugging Face and others will have to strike said Guarav Tewari managing director at Palo Alto-based Omega Venture Partners which has invested in 19 AI-related software companies. MIT professor and Superminds author Thomas Malone said the OpenAI drama illustrates the tension between the power of community such as concerns about AI safety and on the other hand the power of markets such as the desire to increase profits. He said both startups and big tech players can exploit the generative AI market but early over-confidence has never been a winning strategy during waves of innovation. In the history of tech it is hard for dominant players to remain dominant he said. watch now VIDEO 4:53 04:53 Open-source development is making A.I. more competitive says MNTN CEO Mark Douglas The Exchange',\n",
       " 'headline: AI could mean free doctors and lawyers for everybody in 10 years OpenAI investor Vinod Khosla believes.  content: Within the next two-and-a-half decades Vinod Khosla an investor in OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT  thinks we will have access to free professional services and humanlike robots thanks to AI. In a recent episode of Eric Newcomers Cerebral Valley Podcast venture capitalist Khosla made some predictions on what AI could look like in the near future. The 68-year-old billionaire said given AIs impressive capabilities I do think in 10 years well have free doctors free tutors for everybody and free lawyers so they can access the legal system. By 2048 Khosla expects there to be entire populations of robots that stand upright the way humans do. I also forecast in 25 years we will have a billion bipedal robots Khosla said. That will create a massive industry larger than todays auto industry. My bet is well have more than a million in less than 10 years Khosla continued regarding the bipedal robots. On the question of GPT-5 what would be the next iteration of OpenAIs large-language model GPT-4  Khosla expects that AIs capabilities will grow in ways we havent seen yet. We havent seen anywhere near the limits of AI capability Khosla said. Thats a reasonable assumption. That doesnt mean we should be afraid of AI. Earlier in the podcast episode he called sentient AI  the ability for robots to develop consciousness  nonsensical. Instead of thinking about AI doomsday scenarios  like how it could lead to the destruction of humanity he believes that people should be thinking about how AI can make a positive impact on the world. Too many people are looking at the dystopian angle of this one percent probability of something bad happening and ignoring the benefits to humanity of AI Khosla said. He believes the path to reinventing societal infrastructure and providing a resource rich lifestyle to all 7 billion  on the planet runs through AI given its multiplicative power on labor and expertise a spokesperson for Khosla Ventures the investors venture capital firm told Business Insider in an email. It is the only way to realize his dream of near free doctors and tutors 24/7 for every child on the planet. Khosla has been vocal about the potential impacts of AI for years. In 2016 Khosla wrote in a paper that he believes AI automation may displace up to 80% of the work physicians and healthcare workers do. He expanded on this point in March of this year saying that AI could do 80% of jobs in 25 years giving people more time for other pursuits. This large transformation is the opportunity to free humanity from the need to work Khosla told Semafor in an interview. People will work when they want to work on what they want to work on. Its clear that the investor has long believed in the revolutionary potential of AI. After all his VC firm Khosla Ventures invested $50 million into OpenAI in 2019 and poured funds into other AI startups like Replit as well. Still Khosla told Business Insider in October he doesnt want to place too big of a bet on AI at the moment. Given the hype around the technology Khosla thinks that AI startups are overvalued  and that only a few will survive. Investing in momentum is a bad idea Khosla said regarding AI.',\n",
       " 'headline: Metas AI chief doesnt think AI super intelligence is coming anytime soon and is skeptical on quantum computing.  content: Metas chief scientist and deep learning pioneer Yann LeCun said he believes that current AI systems are decades away from reaching some semblance of sentience equipped with common sense that can push their abilities beyond merely summarizing mountains of text in creative ways. His point of view stands in contrast to that of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who recently said AI will be  fairly competitive  with humans in less than five years besting people at a multitude of mentally intensive tasks. I know Jensen LeCun said at a recent event highlighting the Facebook parent companys 10-year anniversary of its Fundamental AI Research team . LeCun said the Nvidia CEO has much to gain from the AI craze. There is an AI war and hes supplying the weapons. [If] you think AGI is in the more GPUs you have to buy LeCun said about technologists attempting to develop artificial general intelligence the kind of AI on par with human-level intelligence. As long as researchers at firms such as OpenAI continue their pursuit of AGI they will need more of Nvidias computer chips. Society is more likely to get cat-level or dog-level AI years before human-level AI LeCun said. And the technology industrys current focus on language models and text data will not be enough to create the kinds of advanced human-like AI systems that researchers have been dreaming about for decades. Text is a very poor source of information LeCun said explaining that it would likely take 20000 years for a human to read the amount of text that has been used to train modern language models. Train a system on the equivalent of 20000 years of reading material and they still dont understand that if A is the same as B then B is the same as A. Theres a lot of really basic things about the world that they just dont get through this kind of training LeCun said. Hence LeCun and other Meta AI executives have been heavily researching how the so-called transformer models used to create apps such as ChatGPT could be tailored to work with a variety of data including audio image and video information. The more these AI systems can discover the likely billions of hidden correlations between these various kinds of data the more they could potentially perform more fantastical feats the thinking goes. Some of Metas research includes software that can help teach people how to play tennis better while wearing the companys Project Aria augmented reality glasses which blend digital graphics into the real world. Executives showed a demo in which a person wearing the AR glasses while playing tennis was able to see visual cues teaching them how to properly hold their tennis rackets and swing their arms in perfect form. The kinds of AI models needed to power this type of digital tennis assistant require a blend of three-dimensional visual data in addition to text and audio in case the digital assistant needs to speak. These so-called multimodal AI systems represent the next frontier but their development wont come cheap. And as more companies such as Meta and Google parent Alphabet research more advanced AI models Nvidia could stand to gain even more of an edge particularly if no other competition emerges. The AI hardware of the future Nvidia has been the biggest benefactor of generative AI with its pricey graphics processing units becoming the standard tool used to train massive language models. Meta relied on 16000 Nvidia A100 GPUs to train its Llama AI software. CNBC asked if the tech industry will need more hardware providers as Meta and other researchers continue their work developing these kinds of sophisticated AI models. It doesnt require it but it would be nice LeCun said adding that the GPU technology is still the gold standard when it comes to AI. Still the computer chips of the future may not be called GPUs he said. What youre going to see hopefully emerging are new chips that are not graphical processing units they are just neural deep learning accelerators LeCun said. LeCun is also somewhat skeptical about quantum computing  which tech giants such as Microsoft  IBM  and Google have all poured resources into. Many researchers outside Meta believe quantum computing machines could supercharge advancements in data-intensive fields such as drug discovery as theyre able to perform multiple calculations with so-called quantum bits as opposed to conventional binary bits used in modern computing. But LeCun has his doubts. The number of problems you can solve with quantum computing you can solve way more efficiently with classical computers LeCun said. Quantum computing is a fascinating scientific topic LeCun said. Its less clear about the practical relevance and the possibility of actually fabricating quantum computers that are actually useful. Meta senior fellow and former tech chief Mike Schroepfer concurred saying that he evaluates quantum technology every few years and believes that useful quantum machines may come at some point but its got such a long time horizon that its irrelevant to what were doing. The reason we started an AI lab a decade ago was that it was very obvious that this technology is going to be commercializable within the next years time frame Schroepfer said.

       " 'headline: Marketing is an art and a science. Here are 3 ways to amplify creativity in the generative-AI era.  content: At a time when marketing technology enhancements generative AI and data availability are emerging faster than ever it can be easy to lose focus on how important human creativity is for marketing. If we offer marketers what they need for creativity to bloom and upskill them on how to use technology and massive data sets the perfect balance of art and science may be achieved. Here are three ideas to help marketing leaders help creativity thrive. 1. Make them allies not alternatives Tech and creativity shouldnt be either / or. They should be best friends. Generative AI can help free your marketers from paperwork number crunching and non-creative writing. It can help them quickly see their ideas on paper the screen or in extended reality. You can then use marketing technology to design monitor and report on a data-driven campaign that will help amplify creativitys impact. Generative AI can then help create derivative personalized versions of the initial idea. The result can be more and better ideas with a broader impact. At our firm we call this approach human-led tech-powered. Tech helps with almost everything we do but the goal is to help make our marketers lives easier and their work more impactful. 2. Show the money As the saying goes follow the money and a lot of money is going to marketing technology. Thats often true for hiring budgets for specialists too. These investments are worth it  but marketing leaders should strike a balance. Youve likely already got a marketing tech stack up and running but now may be the time to spend more on creativity. Put top creative minds and emerging talent on your hiring list  and this doesnt necessarily have to mean more headcount but reallocating the current org structure. Try to make sure that as you are hiring marketing tech specialists and data analysts they can understand and work closely with creatives and traditional marketers. 3. Give time  and credit Every marketer is busy. They may need time and incentives to step away from the technology focus. That can mean slotting in time every week. It can mean financial incentives. Or it can mean contests and awards to encourage friendly competition. In my team we have a creativity quest where everyone is encouraged to take a look at our recurring campaigns and foster competition to exchange new ways to bring life to old tactics and we encourage teaming in responses. Beyond the prize we vocalize credit to the marketers who came up with the idea and measure the ongoing impact. Marketing is fundamentally about people sharing ideas with other people to convince and move them. That requires creativity which in turn requires empathy and imagination. Thats why emerging technologies should not replace people marketers but empower them. Its why marketing leaders will always need to find encourage and amplify creativity in the people on their teams.',\n",
       " 'headline: The tech powering ChatGPT wont make AI as smart as humans. Others might..  content: The groundbreaking work of a bunch of Googlers in 2017 introduced the world to transformers  neural networks that power popular AI products today. They power the large-language model or LLM beneath OpenAIs ChatGPT the chatbot whose explosion onto the scene last year prompted Bill Gates to declare the age of AI has begun. The mission for some AI entrepreneurs now is to realize a sci-fi vision and create artificial general intelligence (AGI) : AI that appears as intelligent as a human. But while transformers can power ChatGPT a preprint paper published by Google researchers last month suggests they might not be able to make the human-like abstractions extrapolations and predictions that would imply were at AGI. ChatGPT merely responds to users prompts with text using the data a human has trained it on. In its earliest public form the chatbot had no knowledge of events beyond September 2021 which it had to acknowledge every time someone asked abut more recent topics. Testing transformers ability to move beyond the data the Google researchers described degradation of their generalization for even simple extrapolation tasks. This has raised the question of whether human-like AI is even possible. Another is whether different technologies may get us there. Some researchers are testing alternatives to figure that out with another new paper suggesting that there might be a better model waiting in the wings. Research submitted to open-access repository ArXiv on December 1 by Albert Gu assistant professor at the machine-learning department of Carnegie Mellon and Tri Dao chief scientist at Together AI introduces a model called Mamba. Quadratic attention has been indispensable for information-dense modalities such as language... until now. Announcing Mamba: a new SSM arch. that has linear-time scaling ultra long context and most importantly--outperforms Transformers everywhere weve tried. With tridao 1/ pic.twitter.com/vXumZqJsdb  Albert Gu (albertgu) December 4 2023 Mamba is a state-space model or SSM and according to Gu and Dao it seems capable of beating transformers on performance in a bunch of tasks. A caveat: Research submitted to ArXiv is moderated but not necessarily peer-reviewed. This means the public gets to see research faster but it isnt necessarily reliable. Like LLMs SSMs are capable of language modeling the process through which chatbots like ChatGPT function. But SSMs do this with mathematical models of different states that users prompts can take. Gu and Daos research states: Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language audio and genomics. On language modeling Mamba outperforms transformers of the same size and matches transformers twice its size both in pretraining and downstream evaluation Gu and Dao noted. Writing on X Dao also noted how a feature particular to SSMs means Mamba is able to generate language responses five times faster than a transformer. Our scan implementation is 30x faster than basic PyTorch/JAX and orders of magnitude faster than quadratic FlashAttention when sequence lengths get long. And because of the fixed-size recurrent state (no KV cache) - Mamba can do LM inference 5x faster than a Transformer. 6/ pic.twitter.com/llc1eZFHLt  Tri Dao (tridao) December 4 2023 In response Dr Jim Fan a research scientist at software company Nvidia wrote on X that hes always excited by new attempts to dethrone transformers. We need more of these. He gave kudos to Dao and Gu for pushing on alternative sequence architectures for many years now. ChatGPT was a landmark cultural event that sparked an AI boom. But its technology looks unlikely to lead the industry to its promised land of human-like intelligence. But if repeated testing confirms Mamba does consistently outperform transformers it could inch the industry closer.',\n",
       " 'headline: How a violent 1800s uprising against machines could foreshadow our future with AI.  content: AI may be a great leveler for the workforce  making people who arent very good at their jobs suddenly become a lot more productive. A crummy programmer can use GitHubs Copilot to write proficient code  while a subpar writer could create perfectly fine marketing copy or seem eloquent over email. But as Business Insiders Aki Ito reports this isnt all upside. If suddenly its easy for anyone to make decent code it becomes hard to justify paying huge salaries to highly talented coders  or paying big bucks to a marketing copywriter with more education and experience. This of course is not the first time new technology has radically transformed our lives and careers . The Industrial Revolution of the 19th century radically changed human labor with a lot of good things (steam trains) coming at the cost of bad things (child labor). Brian Merchant is the author of  Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech  which tells the history of the Luddite rebellion of the early 1800s when clothworkers in rural England banded together and smashed the new weaving machines that factory owners were introducing. I asked Merchant for his perspective on how history informs how we should think about AI and labor. My colleague Aki Ito wrote about how AI will ultimately harm the most talented people in white collar jobs because it will make it harder for them justify sky-high wages. Is that sort of what happened  to the clothworkers in the early 1800s when machines were introduced (taking into account that when were talking about harm in coding jobs people arent exactly going to lose an arm or get maimed) I like what Aki is getting at here because I think that too often economists who look at the macro picture miss just how brutal this process can be  and what stands to be lost to it. Take the clothworkers: skilled weavers made really high quality cloth and framework knitters made stockings that were nice and durable. The stuff would last and the workers took pride in making it. When factory owners started using machines that could emulate on some level that production they still needed human operators. But the work could now be done by children who could be paid a lot less if anything at all. Just about everyone loses except the factory owners who profit from churning out more shoddily made stuff at a rate that the skilled workers cant compete with. Now a few of the highest skilled weavers and clothmakers were just fine  there was still a market for the finest artisanal goods and machine-made stuff couldnt touch any of that. I expect this is a similar dynamic well see play out with AI and a lot of jobs involving things like writing coding illustration and graphic design . In the short term yes you might see more productivity because people who werent as quick at writing marketing emails or web copy or power point slide illustrations can use generative AI services to whip that stuff up. And the highest-skilled most in-demand and best known writers artists and coders will continue to do just fine. Based on your understanding of history what are the chances that AI helps people by lowering the gap between lower skilled and higher skilled workers Now as then the vast vast majority of the time AI absolutely cannot replicate a good writer or workers output. It can produce output that may be passable to managers looking to tell their managers that they saved on labor costs this quarter by firing Ian and Deborah in marketing or whatever and teaching an intern how to use ChatGPT which by the way they just purchased enterprise tier for. But thats the end game and what needs to be understood as the beating heart of all this AI talk its ultimately being sold to every firm that adopts it as a labor-saving and cost-cutting tool period. Something that people say a lot about AI is that it might get rid of some jobs but make new other ones a net even. That wasnt exactly true for the clothworkers of the 1800s right Like jobs didnt change they got actively worse (more dangerous cheaper harder to make a living etc). And youre exactly right  the Industrial Revolution didnt cause a net job loss. But when people say this especially about the Industrial Revolution  that some old jobs were lost but new ones were gained  it always blows my mind a bit. Because the jobs it created are literally some of the worst jobs in human history. Child laborers toiling in windowless factories inhaling cloth fibers and getting their fingers smashed in churning machinery Not great I expect the net impact of AI if it continues to be deployed in the workplace in the contexts weve seen it deployed so far  by managers and executives with little to no input from workers themselves  then the result will be the erosion of the quality of peoples jobs and an accelerating inequality as all those productivity gains get funneled to the top.',\n",
       " 'headline: What would humans do in a world of super-AI.  content: I n Wall-E  a film released in 2008 humans live in what could be described as a world of fully automated luxury communism. Artificially intelligent robots which take wonderfully diverse forms are responsible for all productive labour. People get fat hover in armchairs and watch television. The Culture series by Iain M. Banks  a Scottish novelist goes further considering a world in which ai has grown sufficiently powerful as to be superintelligentoperating far beyond anything now foreseeable. The books are favourites of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk the bosses of Amazon and Tesla respectively. In the world spun by Banks scarcity is a thing of the past and ai minds direct most production. Humans turn to art explore the cultures of the vast universe and indulge in straightforwardly hedonistic pleasures. Such stories may seem far-fetched. But rapid progress in generative ai the sort that underpins Open ai s popular chatbot Chat gpt has caused many to take them more seriously. On May 22nd Open ai s founders published a blog post saying that its conceivable that within the next ten years ai systems will exceed expert skill level in most domains and carry out as much productive activity as one of todays largest corporations. Last summer forecasters on Metaculus an online prediction platform that is a favourite of many techies thought it would take until the early 2040s to produce an ai capable of tricking humans into thinking that it was human after a two-hour chat had good enough robotic capabilities to assemble a model car and could pass various other challenging cognitive tests. After a year of astonishing ai breakthroughs Metaculus forecasters now think that this will happen by the early 2030s. There is no shortage of money for research either. Five new generative- ai unicorns (startups valued at $1bn or more) have already been minted this year. The road to a general ai one better than the very best of humanity at everythingcould take longer than expected . Nevertheless the rising possibility of ultra-powerful ai raises the question of what would be left for humans when it arrives. Would they become couch potatoes as in Wall-E Here is a thought experiment guided by the principles of economics to provide something of an answer. AI is your oyster Inevitably such a thought experiment involves some fairly heroic assumptions. For a start we suppose that ai will be benevolent controllable and distinguishable from humans. We also suppose that human culture will not be radically altered by technological progress to the point that people begin to love or even worship ai s. Instead we imagine ai as a tool: a virtual super-smart dirt-cheap bot. We assume that constraints on the widespread use of ai  such as energy limits will be resolved. None of this is guaranteed but it helps make an exercise like this possible. In 2019 Philippe Aghion Ben Jones and Chad Jones three economists modelled the impact of ai . They found that explosive economic growth was plausible if ai could be used to automate all production including the process of research itselfand thus self-improve. A nearly unlimited number of ai s could work together on any given problem opening up vast scientific possibilities. Yet their modelling carried an important caveat. If ai automated most but not all production or most but not all of the research process growth would not take off. As the economists put it: Economic growth may be constrained not by what we do well but rather by what is essential and yet hard to improve. An idea put forward by William Baumol a late economist offers an explanation for this. In a paper published in 1965 he and William Bowen a colleague examined wages in the performing arts. They noted that the output per man-hour of the violinist playing a Schubert quartet in a standard concert hall is relatively fixed. Even as technological progress made other industries more productive the performing arts remained unaffected. Because humans were still willing to spend on the arts even as prices rosedemand was inelasticthe arts took up more of gdp and therefore weighed on overall growth. Baumols example points to a broader principle. If the domains that ai is able to fully automate are only imperfect substitutes for those which it cannot and the demand for non-automatable industries is hard to budge then the unproductive sectors will grow as a share of gdp  reducing overall growth. Messrs Aghion Jones and Jones note that this is in fact what has happened across much of the past century. Technology has automated swathes of agriculture and manufacturing driving down the relative price of their outputs. As a result people have spent a greater share of their incomes on industries such as education health care and recreation which have not seen the same productivity gains. Will Baumols story matter in a world in which ai is more capable than the most talented humans If the ai is not embodiedmaybe because progress in robotics lags that in computingthen the answer is surely yes. Much of the economy including construction and manufacturing is decidedly physical. There are countless forms of employment including many in health care that require a combination of braininess and an ability to traverse the physical world. These jobs would only increase in importance in a scenario where ai began to dominate cognitive labour. Humans would work in the physical world perhaps under the guidance of ai chief executives or professors. But what if ultra-powerful ai develops super-humanoid robots too Material needs would almost certainly be met by machine hands. One might then expect humanity to give up on toil much like in Wall-E. Indeed in 1930 John Maynard Keynes another economist penned an essay entitled Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren in which he speculated that a century in the future people would work for less than 15 hours a week. The growth generated by technology would solve the economic problem he predicted and allow people to turn their attention to activities that are intrinsically pleasurable. Admittedly Keyness 15-hour work week has not arrivedbut higher levels of wealth which may increase the appeal of leisure have cut working hours much as he expected. The average number of hours worked a week in the rich world has fallen from around 60 in the late 19th century to under 40 today. There are nevertheless some wants that perhaps only humans can satisfy even in a world of supercharged embodied ai. It is also worth noting that what is intrinsically pleasurable may include work. Consider three areas where humans may still have a role: work that is blurred with play play itself and work where humans retain some kind of an advantage. Fun and games Start with the blurring boundary between work and play. Although working hours have fallen over the past century most of the drop was before the 1980s. Increasingly rich people labour for longer than poorer people. Keyness essay hints at an explanation for this odd development. He divided human desires in two: Those needs which are absolute in the sense that we feel them whatever the situation of our fellow human beings may be and those which are relative in the sense that we feel them only if their satisfaction lifts us above makes us feel superior to our fellows. Keynes perhaps underestimated the size of this second class of wants. A cynic might suggest that entire academic disciplines fall into it: existing with no apparent value to the world with academics nevertheless competing furiously for status based on their braininess. Economists would say that for many work has become a consumption good offering far more utility than the income it generates. Games offer another hint as to why people may not stop working altogether. Millions of people are employed in entertainment and sports competing for clout in activities that some consider immaterial. Perhaps when ai s overtake humans interest in watching such games will wane. But evidence from sports where humans are already second-rate suggests otherwise. Since ibm s DeepBlue defeated Garry Kasparov the world grandmaster in chess in 1997 interest in the game has only increased. Other games that have been solved by ai  including Go an ancient Chinese board game and competitive video games have witnessed a similar pattern. Across the world the number of video-game players has nearly doubled in the past decade reaching 3.2bn last year. Nowadays a growing class of gamers compete or stream for a living. ai might supercharge this interest. As Banks speculated humans might specialise in the things that really [matter] in life such as sport games romance studying dead languages barbarian societies and impossible problems and climbing high mountains without the aid of a safety harness. Other humans would presumably want to watch them too. It seems unlikely that people will give up control of politics to robots. Once ai s surpass humans people will presumably pay even closer attention to them. Some political tasks might be delegated: humans could for instance put their preferences into an ai model that produces proposals for how to balance them. Yet as a number of political philosophers including John Locke in the 17th century and John Rawls in the 20th have argued participation in political procedures gives outcomes legitimacy in the eyes of fellow citizens. There would also be more cynical considerations at play. Humans like to have influence over one another. This would be true even in a world in which everyones basic needs and wants are met by machines. Indeed the wealthiest 1% of Americans participate politically at two to three times the rate of the general public on a range of measures from voting to time spent on politics. Last consider areas where humans have an advantage in providing a good or servicecall it a human premium. This premium would preserve demand for labour even in an age of superadvanced ai . One place where this might be true is in making private information public. So long as people are more willing to share their secrets with other people than machines there will be a role for those who are trusted to reveal that information to the world selectively ready for it then to be ingested by machines. Your correspondent would like to think that investigative journalists will still have jobs. The human premium might appear elsewhere too. People value history myths and meaning. Non-fungible tokens for which provenance can be verified on a blockchain are typically valued at many multiples more than images with identical pixels but a different history. In areas such as caregiving and therapy humans derive value from others spending their scarce time with them which adds feeling to an interaction. Artificial diamonds which have the same molecular structure as those from the ground trade at an enormous discountaround 70% by one estimate. In the future items with a made by a human tag might be especially desirable. People problems If this premium is big enough it could even weigh on growth. Divide the sectors of the economy into those with a large human premium and those without. If humans do not substitute machine-produced goods and services for those made by fellow humans the Baumol effect would only deepen. Measured economic growth could even hit zero. Indeed if extremely powerful AI failed to supercharge growth it would suggest that the economy had already moved beyond materiality towards play politics and areas where what people value most of all is interacting with others. Perhaps one day AI s will produce entirely new goods and services that will outcompete the desire to please and interact with other humans. The manner in which such a contest played out would reveal something profound: just how much of a social animal is a human Correction (May 31st 2023) : This article previously misstated the average hours worked per week suggesting that the figure was 60 in the late 20th century rather than the late 19th century.

       " 'headline: Silicon Valley is piling into the business of snooping.  content: I n early September New Yorkers may have noticed an unwelcome guest hovering round their parties. In the lead-up to Labour Day weekend the New York Police Department ( NYPD ) said that it would use drones to look into complaints about festivities including back-yard gatherings. Snooping police drones are an increasingly common sight in America. According to a recent survey by researchers at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law about a quarter of police forces now use them. Even more surprising is where the technology is coming from. Among the NYPD s suppliers is Skydio a Silicon Valley firm that uses artificial intelligence ( AI ) to make drones easy to fly allowing officers to control them with little training. Skydio is backed by Andreessen Horowitz a venture-capital ( VC ) giant and Accel one of its peers. The NYPD is also buying from BRINC  another startup which makes flying machines equipped with night-vision cameras that can smash through windows. Sam Altman of Open AI  the startup behind Chat GPT is among BRINC s investors. It may seem odd that Silicon Valley is helping American law enforcement snoop on troublemakers. Supporting state surveillance sits awkwardly with the libertarian values espoused by many American tech luminaries who came of age in the early days of the internet. Although Silicon Valley got its start supplying chips for Americas defence industry in the 1950s its relations with the state withered as its attention shifted from self-guided missiles to e-commerce and iPhones. Now as the tech industry seeks out new frontiers of growth selling to the state is coming back into vogue. Government is the last remaining holdout from the software revolution wrote Katherine Boyle of Andreessen Horowitz in a blog post last year. Earlier this year the firm launched an American Dynamism fund to invest in government-related industries. Slowly but surely the state is dragging itself into the digital age. At the end of 2022 the Pentagon awarded a $9bn cloud-computing contract to Alphabet Amazon Oracle and Microsoft four tech giants. Last year 11% of the value of federal contracts awarded to businesses was for software and technology up from 8% a decade ago according to The Economist s calculations. Surveillance is one government activity that is being upgraded. New technologies for observation and analysis are transforming the field. Conventional suppliers such as Axon Enterprise and Motorola Solutions which sell cameras and sundry surveillance gubbins to police and other security organisations are being joined by upstarts pushing whizzier technologies. The first of these is drones. That industry has been dominated by DJI  a Chinese manufacturer which last year provided nearly three-quarters of all drones sold in America. This has caused much hand-wringing in American government circles. On November 1st a bill was introduced in Congress that would ban all federal government departments from buying Chinese drones. Some states including Florida have already barred emergency services from doing so. All this is proving a boon for the likes of Skydio and Brinc . Other types of aerial snooping device are also in the works. Skydweller another startup is developing an autonomous solar-powered aircraft that will not have to land to recharge. That says the firm would allow for persistent surveillance. A second ascendant technology is satellites. SpaceX Elon Musks rocket company and its copycats have helped reduce the price of sending objects into space to around one-tenth of the level two decades ago. That has led to a carpeting of low-Earth orbit with satellites around one-eighth of which are used for observing the planet. PitchBook a data firm reckons there are now nearly 200 companies in the business of selling satellite imageryso many that the market has become commoditised according to Trae Stephens of Founders Fund another VC firm. BlackSky one of those firms says it can take an image of a spot on Earth every hour or so. Satellite imagery has come a long way since 2013 when police in Oregon used pictures from Google Earth to uncover an illegal marijuana plantation in a residents yard. Techies are also selling tools to help law enforcement make better use of the profusion of images and information now at their fingertips. Ambient. AI  another startup backed by Andreessen Horowitz has developed technology that automatically monitors cameras for suspicious activity. Palantir a data-mining firm that has injected itself into Americas military-industrial complex sells its tools to the likes of the Los Angeles Police Department. Facial-recognition software is now used more widely across America too with around a tenth of police forces having access to the technology. A report released in September by Americas Government Accountability Office found that six federal law-enforcement agencies including the FBI and the Secret Service were together executing an average of 69 facial-recognition searches every day. Among the top vendors listed was Clearview AI  a company backed by Peter Thiel a VC veteran. Silicon snoops Surveillance capabilities may soon be further fortified by generative AI  of the type that powers Chat GPT  thanks to its ability to work with unstructured data such as images and video footage. Will Marshall the boss of Planet Labs a satellite firm says that analysing satellite imagery with the technology will let users search the Earth for objects much as Google lets users search the internet for information. For the newcomers selling clever new surveillance technologies to the government is not easy. Rick Smith the boss of Axon notes that there are 18000 police departments in America. One-fifth of them do not use electronic records. Until 2009 the NYPD was still buying typewriters. For newcomers that do gain a foothold the rewards can be rich. David Ulevitch who runs Andreessen Horowitzs American Dynamism fund observes that word of mouth can spread fast creating virality. Fusus a startup that sells real-time crime-monitoring software says its sales grew by over 300% last year albeit from a low base. In 2017 Flock Safety another startup launched a licence-plate reader that is now used in 47 American states. Whats more notes Paul Kwan of General Catalyst another VC firm relationships with government buyers once established tend to last a long time. The bigger firms are adapting. Motorola Solutions has made 15 acquisitions since 2019 including Calipsa a video-analytics tool and WatchGuard which makes cameras for cop-car dashboards. Axon has also acquired startups and taken stakes in others including Fusus and Skydio. The application of new technological wizardry to the job of watching citizens will make many uncomfortable. In 2020 Amazon Microsoft and IBM stopped providing facial-recognition services to law-enforcement agencies because of worries about privacy. But surveillance is likely to remain lucrative not least because governments are not the only customers for these technologies. Skydios drones assess cell towers and bridges for damage. Hedge funds use satellite imagery to count the cars in retailers parking lots hoping to gauge their revenues ahead of market disclosures. SmartEye a Swedish firm sells eye-tracking technology to monitor the moods of pilots. It also sells its wares to advertising firms. The trend towards greater surveillance whether by big brother or big business looks unlikely to reverse.',\n",

At a panel discussion as part of the Moneycontrol Startup Conclave in Bengaluru earlier this month Tipping Point: The AI Era - Separating hype from the reality decoding the India opportunity Singh had said that the government is implementing along with industry and academia a generative AI solution called Bhashini. He referred to the millions of people in India who are still not connected to the internet and who would require access to e-services in local languages. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Launched in 2022 under the National Language Translation Mission (NLTM) by MeitY Bhashini aims to build a National Public Digital Platform for languages and to increase the content in Indian languages on the internet substantially. It (Bhashini) could allow people to actually give a voice command and get a reply with regard to which services a person should be eligible for - or how do you get access to PM Kisan Card  and so on. So these services were built using that. We feel that once this is done it will provide huge access to services Singh said. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) executive pointed at the challenges in computation with the advent of generative AI. The biggest challenge that we have is of computing. We do see that if we are able to provide access to compute to Indian researchers and startups they will be able to use the data to develop solutions which will help easier diagnosis of diseases easier access to agricultural services of farmers etc he said. Also present in the panel was Vishal Dhupar MD Asia South Nvidia who explained how generative AI was supplementing to the work of software engineers We have reached a space where we can augment the work of a software engineers.

Pandurang Nayak Head of Startups Solutions Architect AWS India acknowledged the need for upskilling and explained the offerings that the company has in this area. While our overarching thing has been about democratizing (large language models) and taking these models out of research and academia and bringing it for everybody to use we also are looking at how we can develop and build on those skill sets.

It may be that people are not talking about enough because what could change is quite fundamental. It could change the nature of the world economy it could change the nature of jobs nature of work certainly the nature of innovation and startups because these foundation models that are coming through are a layer of intelligence that can go into everything that you build.

       " 'headline: GPTZero App seeks to thwart AI plagiarism in schools online media.  content: GPTZero App seeks to thwart AI plagiarism in schools online media Journalists screenwriters and college professors are among widening groups of people who are concerned about eventually losing their livelihoods to artificial intelligence programs like ChatGPT which can produce copy faster and possibly better than humans. But one entrepreneur is pursuing technology to make it easier to distinguish between text written by people and that composed by a machine. Edward Tian a 22-year-old Princeton University student studying computer science and journalism developed an app called GPTZero to deter the misuse of the viral chatbot ChatGPT in classrooms. The app has racked up 1.2 million registered users since January. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Hes now launching a new program called Origin aimed at saving journalism by distinguishing AI-generated disinformation from fact in online media. Tian has secured $3.5 million in funding co-led by Uncork Capital and Neo Capital with tech investors including Emad Mostaque chief executive officer of Stability AI Ltd and Jack Altman. GPTZero analyzes the randomness of text known as perplexity and the uniformity of this randomness within the text  called burstiness  to identify when AI is being used. The tool has an accuracy rate of 99% for human text and 85% on AI text according to the company. The 10-person team now wants to empower journalism and is talking with large media organizations like the BBC and industry executives including New York Times former Chief Executive Officer Mark Thompson to discuss partnerships for AI detection and analysis. The company also sees its technology for use in fields of trust-and-safety government copyright finance law and more. We believe we can get the smartest people working on AI detection in a room together said Tian. The field of detection is so new and we believe it deserves more attention and support. Lack of Tools Open AI the company behind ChatGPT has launched an AI text classifier to detect machine-generated content but its far from foolproof. The tool correctly identifies only 26% of AI-written text as likely AI-written while incorrectly labeling human-written text as AI-written 9% of the time. The classifier also works significantly worse in languages other than English and is unreliable on code and shorter texts. For inputs that are very different from text in the tools training set the classifier could also be wrong according to OpenAI. Our classifier has a number of important limitations the company acknowledges on the website. It should not be used as a primary decision-making tool but instead as a complement to other methods of determining the source of a piece of text. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad The lack of reliability of the detection tool poses a dilemma for educators. Even if a teacher finds a suspicious article from a student thats flagged with a 70% likelihood of being AI-generated as long as the accuracy of those detection tools isnt 100% its very hard for teachers to take decisive action. I dont think we know what to do with a flag that says there might be an issue said Jack Cushman director of the Harvard Library Innovative Lab which explores topics such as the impact of the internet. All you can do at that point is talk with a student and say you might have committed academic dishonesty according to this tool. Meanwhile the definition of plagiarism is also evolving with the emergence of AI. It is going to challenge the whole notion of academic honesty because sometimes having a tool that recommends a sentence or two or help with citations is going to be legitimate in the same way as using calculator to do math work he said. The best answer is you shouldnt let it write the whole thing. Rise of Deepfakes Nick Loui co-founder and CEO of PeakMetrics a startup that helps governments and large companies combat disinformation said his clients arent concerned about the threat of AI-generated texts as much because the potential for harm is less than from the proliferation of deepfake videos for example where there have been more malicious instances of manipulated content. The technical limitations so far of any detection technology and a lack of a clear path to monetization has made it difficult to attract investment. The current detection tools are transitory products said Sheila Gulati managing director at Tola Capital a VC firm that focuses on AI startups as blocking new and emergent technology is generally not a great way for people to leverage it. I think the eventual state of this will just be much more sophisticated. Some industry observers say open sourcing which makes softwares source code publicly available and allows users to view modify and distribute it freely is good for large language model products as it reduces costs increases transparency and promotes innovation. However open-source is also more easily hackable and can make the detection tools more prone to exploits. Its a bit like showing a burglar the blueprint for how your home surveillance network is set up said Alex Cui chief technology officer and a co-founder of GPTZero.',\n",

(Image: AFP) Sam Altman the tech titan behind ChatGPT was abruptly fired on November 17 by OpenAI the company that launched the revolutionary artificial intelligence chatbot.

The technological progress we make in the next 100 years will be far larger than all weve made since we first controlled fire and invented the wheel Altman said in a 2021 blog post. Startup guru Born in 1985 into a Jewish family Altman grew up in a St. Louis suburb where he got his first computer at the age of eight according to a long profile in the New Yorker from 2016. Computers and access to online community enabled helped him to navigate being gay in a conservative part of the country Altman said in an interview with Esquire.

       " 'headline: The aliens have landed and we created them: Niall Ferguson.  content: Niall Ferguson It is not every day that I read a prediction of doom as arresting as Eliezer Yudkowskys in Time magazine last week. The most likely result of building a superhumanly smart AI under anything remotely like the current circumstances he wrote is that literally everyone on Earth will die. Not as in maybe possibly some remote chance but as in that is the obvious thing that would happen.  If somebody builds a too-powerful AI under present conditions I expect that every single member of the human species and all biological life on Earth dies shortly thereafter. Do I have your attention now Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Yudkowsky is not some random Cassandra. He leads the Machine Intelligence Research Institute a nonprofit in Berkeley California and has already written extensively on the question of artificial intelligence. I still remember vividly when I was researching my book Doom his warning that someone might unwittingly create an AI that turns against us  for example I suggested because we tell it to halt climate change and it concludes that annihilating Homo sapiens is the optimal solution. It was Yudkowsky who some years ago proposed a modified Moores law: Every 18 months the minimum IQ necessary to destroy the world drops by one point. Now Yudkowsky has gone further. He believes we are fast approaching a fatal conjuncure in which we create an AI more intelligent than us which does not do what we want and does not care for us nor for sentient life in general.  The likely result of humanity facing down an opposed superhuman intelligence is a total loss. He is suggesting that such an AI could easily escape from the internet to build artificial life forms in effect waging biological warfare on us. His recommendation is clear. We need a complete global moratorium on the development of AI. This goes much further than the open letter signed by Elon Musk Steve Wozniak (the Apple co-founder) and more than 15000 other luminaries that calls for a six-month pause in the development of AIs more powerful than the current state of the art. But their motivation is the same as Yudkowskys: the belief that developing AI with superhuman capabilities in the absence of any international regulatory framework risks catastrophe. The only real difference is that Yudkowsky doubts that such a framework can be devised inside half a year. He is almost certainly right about that. The obvious analogy is with two previous fields of potentially lethal scientific research: nuclear weapons and biological warfare. We knew from very early in the history of these fields that the potential for catastrophe was enormous  if not the extinction of humanity then at least death on a vast scale. Yet the efforts to curb the proliferation of nuclear and biological weapons took much longer than six months and were only partly successful. In 1946 the US proposed the Baruch Plan to internationalize nuclear research. But the Soviet Union rejected it and there was soon a frenetic nuclear arms race. The most that was achieved was to limit the number of countries that possessed nuclear weapons (through the Non-Proliferation Treaty which came into force in 1970) and to slow down and eventually reverse the growth of superpower arsenals. Similarly the Biological Weapons Convention that came into force in 1975 did not wholly end research into such weapons. The Soviets never desisted. And we know that all kinds of very hazardous biological research goes on in China and elsewhere including the gain-of-function experiments with coronaviruses which it seems increasingly likely led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad So if Yudkowsky is right that AI is potentially as dangerous as nuclear or biological weapons a six-month pause is unlikely to achieve much. On the other hand his call for a complete freeze on research and development has about as much chance of success as the Baruch Plan. One obvious difference between those older deadly weapons and AI is that most research on AI is being done by the private sector. According to the latest report of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI global private investment in artificial intelligence totaled $92 billion in 2022 of which more than half was in the US. A total of 32 significant machine-learning models were produced by private companies compared to just three produced by academic institutions. Good luck turning all that off. But is the analogy with what we used to call The Bomb correct That depends on your taste in science fiction. Just about everyone has heard of Skynet which originated in the 1984 film The Terminator starring a young Arnold Schwarzenegger. For younger readers the premise is that Skynet a computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics goes rogue in the future and attempts to wipe out humanity with a nuclear attack. John Connor leads the human resistance to Skynet and its robot Terminators. Skynet responds by sending Terminators back in time  because of course time travel is easy if youre a really powerful AI  to kill Connors mother. Yet there are many other versions of AI in science fiction. For example in Ted Chiangs Lifecycle of Software Objects (2010) AI manifests itself as digients  initially harmless and helpless computer-generated pets and companions a little like baby chimpanzees. They spend quite a long time learning to be intelligent. In this version of the world the moral problem is that we humans are tempted to exploit the digients as robot slaves or sex toys. In essence Yudkowskys numerous critics want us to believe that AI is more digient than Skynet. Writing on Twitter Matt Parlmer founder of the machine-tool firm GenFab accused Yudkowsky and the other hardline anti-AI cultists of being out of their depth both in terms of command of basic technical elements of this field but also in terms of their emotional states.  Many things are coming Skynet is not one of them. Shutting down AI research argued Parlmer would deprive sick people of potential breakthroughs in medical science. Nicholas Thompson the CEO of the Atlantic agreed that Yudkowsky and other Luddites were overstating the risks. I recently made a childrens book for my 9-year-olds birthday using Dall-E and GPT-4 about a World Cup between his stuffed animals he told Atlantic staff. The bears won and he loved it.  Lets all build in some time to experiment. Well make cool stuff and well learn while we do it. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Tyler Cowen was more pragmatic. He posed some hypothetical questions: What if in 2006 we had collectively decided to suspend the development of social media for six months while we pondered possible harms from its widespread use Its effects were hardly obvious at the time and they are still contested. In the meantime after the six-month delay how much further along would we have been in the evaluation process And even if American companies institute a six-month pause whos to say that Chinese companies will But the most eloquent defender of unrestrained AI research and development is my old friend Reid Hoffman the founder of LinkedIn who has written an entire book on the subject  approximately half of which was generated by AI. For the lay reader the problem with this debate is twofold. First the defenders of AI all seem to be quite heavily invested in AI. Second they mostly acknowledge that there is at least some risk in developing AIs with intelligence superior to ours. Hoffmans bottom line seems to be: Trust us to do this ethically because if you restrain us the bad guys will be the ones who do the development and then you may get Skynet. So let me offer a disinterested view. I have zero skin in this game. I have no investments in AI nor does it threaten my livelihood. Sure the most recent large language models can generate passable journalism but journalism is my hobby. The AI doesnt yet exist that could write a better biography of Henry Kissinger than I can not least because a very large number of the relevant historical documents are not machine-readable. Let us begin by being more precise about what we are discussing. Most AI does things that offer benefits not threats to humanity. For example DeepMinds AlphaFold has determined the structures of around 200 million proteins a huge scientific leap forward. The debate we are having today is about a particular branch of AI: the large language models (LLMs) produced by organizations such as OpenAI notably ChatGPT and its more powerful successor GPT-4. The backstory of OpenAI is a fascinating one. When I moved to California seven years ago I participated in a discussion with Sam Altman one of the founders of OpenAI. As I recall he assured the audience that within five years AI-powered self-driving vehicles would have rendered every truck driver in America redundant. Like me you may have missed the fleet of self-driving trucks on our highways and the crowds of unemployed truckers learning to code on the streets of San Francisco. Like his former partner Elon Musk Altman realized at some point that teaching neural networks to drive was harder than they had assumed. Hence OpenAIs pivot to LLMs. As a report in the Wall Street Journal made clear the original vision of OpenAI in 2015 was that it would be a nonprofit precisely because of the inherent dangers of such AI. In Altmans own words: If youre making AI it is potentially very good potentially very terrible. However it rapidly became apparent that building LLMs powerful enough to generate credible results was too expensive for a nonprofit because of the huge computing power required. So Altman created a for-profit arm of OpenAI and sold a large stake to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella who saw a golden opportunity to catch up with Google hitherto the leader in AI development. In the long run Altman told the Journal he wants to set up a global governance structure that would oversee decisions about the future of AI and gradually reduce the power OpenAIs executive team has over its technology. OpenAIs ultimate mission he went on is to build artificial general intelligence safely. The goal is to avoid a race toward building dangerous AI systems fueled by competition and instead prioritize the safety of humanity. In the short run however Altman is now part of that race. And this of course is why he has fallen out not only with Musk whose company Tesla is also in the race but also with OpenAIs lead safety researcher Dario Amodei who has quit OpenAI to set up his own AI company called Anthropic which is backed by  Google. So just how dangerous is this for-profit LLM race Superficially not dangerous at all. As my favorite genius Stephen Wolfram explains an AI such as ChatGPT is always fundamentally trying to  produce a reasonable continuation of whatever text its got so far where by reasonable we mean what one might expect someone to write after seeing what people have written on billions of webpages.  When ChatGPT does something like write an essay what its essentially doing is just asking over and over again given the text so far what should the next word be  and each time adding a word. GPT-4 is just an even more powerful word-predicting neural network doing vast numbers of operations on arrays of numbers with GPUs  the processing units originally designed to accelerate graphics rendering. As a result its output is even more convincingly humanlike than ChatGPTs. If you dont believe me look at what GPT-4 came up with when Reid Hoffman asked it to answer the question How many restaurant inspectors does it take to change a lightbulb in the style of Jerry Seinfeld: GPT-4: What is the deal with restaurant inspectors Theyre always poking around in the kitchen checking the temperature of the meat looking for signs of rodents but they never seem to help out with anything. Have you ever seen a restaurant inspector change a lightbulb No of course not. Theyre too busy writing up violations and handing out fines. You know what they do when they see a lightbulb thats out They mark it down on their clipboard and tell the owner to fix it by next week or else. Or else what Or else theyll come back and check the lightbulb again. Thats their big threat. Theyre not going to change it for you theyre not going to lend you a ladder theyre not going to offer any advice on how to unscrew the old one and screw in the new one. Theyre just going to stare at you with that smug look on their face and say You know this is a serious safety hazard. You could have a fire you could have a lawsuit you could have a bad Yelp review. You better get on that pal. And then they leave and youre left with a dark corner of your dining room where no one wants to sit where the food looks unappetizing where the mood is gloomy. And you think to yourself how many restaurant inspectors does it take to change a lightbulb None. They dont change lightbulbs. They just make you feel bad about yours. Not only is that pretty plausible but according to a thorough report by Bubeck et al. (2023) GPT-4 can also solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics coding vision medicine law psychology and more without needing any special prompting and with strikingly close to human-level performance. Well how about superhuman-level GPT-4 was easily able to write a proof of infinitude of primes in the form of a poem to draw a unicorn in TiKZ (a language for creating graphics ) to create a complex animation in Python and to solve a high-school level mathematical problem. Ive read that report carefully. GPT-4 is much smarter than me. So whats the problem apart from the obvious fact that millions of comedy writers  not to mention lawyers journalists and just about everyone else who writes down words for a living (apart from me obviously)  will now have to retrain as truck drivers Hoffman acknowledges that a problem exists. He notes the well-documented shortcomings of LLMs such as the problem of hallucinations  a fancy word for their tendency to make stuff up. This makes me somewhat wary of his proposal to use GPT-4 to flood the zone with truth (or maybe just truthiness) to dilute the flood of fake news. Even GPT-4 cannot deny the downside risk. Hoffman asks it the question: Once large language models are fully developed and deployed what would you suspect will be the worst effects on the quality of overall cultural production In addition to the mass unemployment of professional writers it suggests two: 1. Homogenization and loss of diversity: Large language models could generate massive amounts of content that mimic existing styles genres and trends but lack originality creativity and authenticity. This could result in a saturation of the cultural market with bland and repetitive products that appeal to the lowest common denominator and discourage innovation and experimentation. 2. Manipulation and deception: Large language models could also be used to create deceptive or harmful content that exploits human biases emotions and preferences. This could include fake news propaganda misinformation deepfakes scams or hate speech that undermine trust democracy and social cohesion. Sorry Reid but No. 2 is a much much bigger problem than your habitual techno-optimism allows. Let me now offer a different analogy from nukes and biowarfare. The more I read about GPT-4 the more I think we are talking here not about artificial intelligence (i.e. synthetic humanlike intelligence) but inhuman intelligence which we have designed and trained to sound convincingly like us. I am reminded of Liu Cixins The Dark Forest which describes the invasion of Earth by the ruthless and technologically superior Trisolarans. In effect we are building the aliens to save them from having to make the long journey from outer space. And the core lesson of that book is that the aliens have to destroy us if we are not quick to destroy them. These are the axioms of Lius cosmic sociology: First survival is the primary need of civilization. Second civilization continuously grows and expands but the total matter in the universe remains constant. Third chains of suspicion and the risk of a technological explosion in another civilization mean that in this universe there can only be the law of the jungle. Another sci-fi analogy that comes to mind is John Wyndhams Day of the Triffids (1951) in which most of humanity is first blinded by rays from satellites and then wiped out by carnivorous plants genetically engineered  by the dastardly Soviets  and farmed for their vegetable oil. As Bill the central character observes: Nobody can ever see what a major discovery is going to lead to  whether it is a new kind of engine or a triffid  and we coped with them all right in normal conditions. We benefited quite a lot from them as long as the conditions were to their disadvantage. Why might GPT-4 (or -5) turn triffid on us Because we are feeding it all the data in the world and a lot of that data from the most respectable sources says that the world is threatened by man-made climate change. The obvious solution to that problem must be to decimate or wholly eradicate homo sapiens thereby also conserving energy to generate the ever-growing computing power necessary for GPT-6 -7 and -8. How might AI off us Not by producing Schwarzenegger-like killer androids but merely by using its power to mimic us in order to drive us individually insane and collectively into civil war. You dont believe me Well how about the Belgian father of two who committed suicide after talking to an AI chatbot for weeks about his fears of climate change The chatbot was powered by GPT-J an open-source alternative to OpenAIs ChatGPT. As my Hoover Institution colleague Manny Rincon-Cruz says: LLMs dont manipulate atoms or bits they manipulate us. And its not so much that GPT-5 will decide to wipe us out. Rather the risk is that we will tear ourselves apart as a species by using LLMs for ignoble or nefarious ends. Its simply astonishing to me that Reid Hoffman can write an entire book about the implications of AI without seriously reflecting on what its going to do to American politics. After what social media  from Facebook ads to loaded Google searches to Twitterbots  did in 2016 We are already well on our way to Raskolnikovs nightmare at the end of Crime and Punishment in which humanity goes collectively mad and descends into internecine slaughter. If you still cannot foresee how GPT-4 will be used in 2024 to flood the zone with deepfake content then I suggest you email Eliezer Yudkowsky. But just make sure its really him who replies.',\n",

It is important to not only see who is developing AI but also who is deploying it. People are saying we shouldnt make the same mistake with AI as in social media. People had become too euphoric without taking into account the risks he said. Tata Sons chairman Chandrasekaran struck an optimistic note stating that in a country like India AI will create jobs because it will empower people with few or no skills to perform higher-level jobs. This bold perspective comes as a timely addition to the ongoing dialogue about AIs profound influence on the job market. Catch all LIVE updates on B20 India Summit here Chandrasekaran stated that AIs impact would not lead to job displacement. Instead it would catalyse the creation of new jobs by empowering individuals of diverse skill levels to engage in more advanced tasks. A nurse will be able to take on the workload of a doctor and thats how it will scale up people Chandrasekaran said. Regarding the concerns about the technology Chandrasekaran said There are two main concerns about AI: Will it take away jobs and will it protect privacy I believe that it will create jobs in the country. India has taken a techno-legal approach to data privacy adding that we need to embrace AI. IBMs Krishna added that higher-level cognitive tasks still very much require humans. The more mundane tasks can be done by AI. We found coding productivity can be increased by 60 percent with AI the IBM chairman added. On the issue of regulation Smith said People want to be confident that AI will remain under human control. We need to create a regulatory blueprint at the model layer and application layer. This regulatory blueprint will require action at the private sector level national level and global level.',\n",

Nearly one year after its launch CXOs of Indian start-ups wield ChatGPT-like Generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a silent artisan sculpting efficiency. From expediting idea generation to automating repetitive tasks and saving operating costs leaders have harnessed AIs prowess. In data analytics Generative AI also known as GenAI accelerates exploratory data analysis (EDA) streamlining insights extraction. HR tech adopts it to gauge candidates adaptability evaluate dynamic work environment fit and alignment with team dynamics. Minimising manual intervention CXOs say propels efficiency enabling teams to focus on strategic initiatives. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Generative AI is designed to generate new original content. Unlike traditional AI systems that are programmed to perform specific tasks or make decisions based on predefined rules generative AI can create content autonomously. This type of AI relies on neural networks particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer models to analyse and see patterns from large datasets. OpenAIs ChatGPT DALL-E and UIzard NVIDIAs StyleGAN and Googles DeepDream are among the most popular Gen AI used by people in decision-making. Using it for business Earlier obtaining a large amount of real-world data was challenging for teaching Big Data to thousands of students.

Some of the AI tools Mittal finds most useful are PyTorch Databricks Data Intelligence Platform GitHub Copilot IBM Watson Analytics and ChatGPT. With the time saved in this I can focus more on new evolving technology stack and upskilling he told Moneycontrol . On the other hand the interview-as-a-software (IaaS) platform InCruiter leverages cutting-edge AI interview software like IncBot to streamline initial candidate screening. IncBot automates repetitive tasks employing natural language processing (NLP) to conduct interviews. It assesses candidate responses evaluates qualifications and processes vast data sets.

Need less but qualified employees For some Gen AI has been a productivity booster reducing the time lag as well as churning out ideas in quicker time. Being a non-tech founder the biggest gain Sidhharrth S Kumaar Founder  Chief Happiness Officer of astrology firm NumroVani has seen from Gen AI is description-based images in less than a minute or so. This capability to visualise the ideas and primary thought in mind in less than 60 seconds or so  powered by Midjourney DALL-E Hot Mods and others  has reduced time to get it designed and then see the visualisation and study whether it makes sense or not Kumaar said. Now the process of supervising and sharing feedback with designers is eliminated. The other areas where it has helped are quick data analysis and content improvisation. At my level leading a young start-up with smaller teams needs agile functioning and a lot of those are data pointers he said. This has also led to cost saving of almost 35 percent especially in graphic design and content writing. For instance one person can handle and manage the work of three persons without compromising quality. Gen AI has helped enhance my productivity by almost 20 percent and as I polish my skills in Gen AI and related things this productivity metric will go as high as 40 percent in due course of time Kumaar added.

GenAI may excel in data-driven insights but CXOs argue that it lacks the nuanced understanding and adaptability crucial for navigating the unpredictable entrepreneurial landscape. Generative AI has immense potential to augment and complement human capabilities rather than replace them entirely. While it excels in automating routine tasks and processing vast amounts of data it still requires human oversight for creative thinking and strategic planning said Meet Shah CEO and Founder of BeBetta. CXOs say human expertise is still crucial for tasks such as problem definition interpreting results and making decisions based on the broader context. Even if Generative AI can generate patterns and insights from data TrendyTechs Mittal said interpreting it requires human expertise. He gave an example: Suppose a retail ethnic wear company uses data science to optimise its inventory management. The algorithm recommends reducing stock levels for a particular set of products based on historical sales data. However a human expert with knowledge of the industry context might be aware of a marketing campaign or seasonal trend that could significantly impact future sales.

President Joe Biden on Monday will sign a sweeping executive order to guide the development of artificial intelligence requiring industry to develop safety and security standards introducing new consumer protections and giving federal agencies an extensive to-do list to oversee the rapidly progressing technology. The order reflects the governments effort to shape how AI evolves in a way that can maximize its possibilities and contain its perils. AI has been a source of deep personal interest for Biden with its potential to affect the economy and national security. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad White House chief of staff Jeff Zients recalled Biden giving his staff a directive to move with urgency on the issue having considered the technology a top priority. We cant move at a normal government pace Zients said the Democratic president told him. We have to move as fast if not faster than the technology itself. In Bidens view the government was late to address the risks of social media and now U.S. youth are grappling with related mental health issues. AI has the positive ability to accelerate cancer research model the impacts of climate change boost economic output and improve government services among other benefits. But it could also warp basic notions of truth with false images deepen racial and social inequalities and provide a tool to scammers and criminals. The order builds on voluntary commitments already made by technology companies. Its part of a broader strategy that administration officials say also includes congressional legislation and international diplomacy a sign of the disruptions already caused by the introduction of new AI tools such as ChatGPT that can generate new text images and sounds. Using the Defense Production Act the order will require leading AI developers to share safety test results and other information with the government. The National Institute of Standards and Technology is to create standards to ensure AI tools are safe and secure before public release. The Commerce Department is to issue guidance to label and watermark AI-generated content to help differentiate between authentic interactions and those generated by software. The order also touches on matters of privacy civil rights consumer protections scientific research and worker rights. Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad Story continues below Advertisement Remove Ad An administration official who previewed the order on a Sunday call with reporters said the to-do lists within the order will be implemented and fulfilled over the range of 90 days to 365 days with the safety and security items facing the earliest deadlines. The official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity as required by the White House. Last Thursday Biden gathered his aides in the Oval Office to review and finalize the executive order a 30-minute meeting that stretched to 70 minutes despite other pressing matters including the mass shooting in Maine the Israel-Hamas war and the selection of a new House speaker. Biden was profoundly curious about the technology in the months of meetings that led up to drafting the order. His science advisory council focused on AI at two meetings and his Cabinet discussed it at two meetings. The president also pressed tech executives and civil society advocates about the technologys capabilities at multiple gatherings. He was as impressed and alarmed as anyone deputy White House chief of staff Bruce Reed said in an interview. He saw fake AI images of himself of his dog. He saw how it can make bad poetry. And hes seen and heard the incredible and terrifying technology of voice cloning which can take three seconds of your voice and turn it into an entire fake conversation. The possibility of false images and sounds led the president to prioritize the labelling and watermarking of anything produced by AI. Biden also wanted to thwart the risk of older Americans getting a phone call from someone who sounded like a loved one only to be scammed by an AI tool. Meetings could go beyond schedule with Biden telling civil society advocates in a ballroom of San Franciscos Fairmont Hotel in June This is important. Take as long as you need. The president also talked with scientists and saw the upside that AI created if harnessed for good. He listened to a Nobel Prize-winning physicist talk about how AI could explain the origins of the universe. Another scientist showed how AI could model extreme weather like 100-year floods as the past data used to assess these events has lost its accuracy because of climate change. The issue of AI was seemingly inescapable for Biden. At Camp David one weekend he relaxed by watching the Tom Cruise film Mission: Impossible  Dead Reckoning Part One. The films villain is a sentient and rogue AI known as the Entity that sinks a submarine and kills its crew in the movies opening minutes. If he hadnt already been concerned about what could go wrong with AI before that movie he saw plenty more to worry about said Reed who watched the film with the president. With Congress still in the early stages of debating AI safeguards Bidens order stakes out a U.S. perspective as countries around the world race to establish their own guidelines. After more than two years of deliberation the European Union is putting the final touches on a comprehensive set of regulations that targets the riskiest applications for the technology. China a key AI rival to the U.S. has also set some rules. U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also hopes to carve out a prominent role for Britain as an AI safety hub at a summit this week that Vice President Kamala Harris plans to attend. The U.S. particularly its West Coast is home to many of the leading developers of cutting-edge AI technology including tech giants Google Meta and Microsoft and AI-focused startups such as OpenAI maker of ChatGPT. The White House took advantage of that industry weight earlier this year when it secured commitments from those companies to implement safety mechanisms as they build new AI models. But the White House also faced significant pressure from Democratic allies including labor and civil rights groups to make sure its policies reflected their concerns about AIs real-world harms. The American Civil Liberties Union is among the groups that met with the White House to try to ensure were holding the tech industry and tech billionaires accountable so that algorithmic tools work for all of us and not just a few said ReNika Moore director of the ACLUs racial justice program. Suresh Venkatasubramanian a former Biden administration official who helped craft principles for approaching AI said one of the biggest challenges within the federal government has been what to do about law enforcements use of AI tools including at U.S. borders.

The report titled Indias SaaS Revolution: Exploring global opportunities in a dynamic market highlighted the disruptive effects of generative AI and how India SaaS is poised to leapfrog to SaaS.AI. Generative AI is a type of AI technology that can produce various types of content including text imagery and audio by feeding prompts into the platform like a question. A few pure-play Gen AI SaaS startups from India include Composio Workhack and Rapidclaims. It has been the buzzword and has even attracted software giants like SAP Salesforce and IBM to explore this space. While the West has been fast to adopt the same Indian SaaS and tech companies are now getting on the generative AI bus. Hotspots of activity around Gen AI are emerging particularly in horizontal applications space like marketing automation sales and customer support audio-video design tools and productivity tools the report said. Early-stage SaaS companies in heavily disrupted areas are encouraged to pivot and remodel their businesses around Gen AI. Larger incumbents can adopt a dual approach: integrating Gen AI into their existing operations while simultaneously building new AI-centered businesses the report said.

SaaSBoomis report also projected that the 2025 estimates will be around $15-20 million. The report said that there are around 3500 SaaS firms in India with 19 unicorns and around 80 SaaS companies with more than $10 million ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) as shown in the report. Despite macroeconomic pressure we are seeing healthy growthIf we look at the data there are around 3500 SaaS startups and around 40% of the revenues are from mid-market firms. We are touching not just large enterprises but even SMBs and mid-market enterprises. This is significant said Noshir Kaka Senior Partner and Global Head of McKinseys TMT practice addressing the media. Gen AI Opportunity for Indian SaaS Firms The report said that the Indian SaaS companies stand poised to embrace this wave of Generative AI by building AI-powered products leveraging the depth of domain and functional expertise available in India. Together Fund which launched its Fund II on Thursday with a total corpus of $150 million is looking to invest in companies that solve using Generative AI. We had been investing in DevTools (Developer Tools) SaaS and a few artificial intelligence (AI)-based startups from our Fund I and now the difference is that AI has come on top. We will continue to focus on the Business-to-Business (B2B) segment and within that AI and SaaS are the main focus areas for us said Manav Garg in an interaction with Moneycontrol on Jun 26th. From creating new AI or artificial intelligence capabilities to integrating AI chatbot ChatGPT into customer-centric operations Indias top software-as-a-service (SaaS) firms are investing and exploring Gen AI to attract investors and eventually bring down their customer acquisition costs. In fact Girish Mathrubootham the CEO of cloud-based software services company Freshworks said in an interview that the firm will make significant investments to integrate AI especially generative AI into its operations. Indian SaaS giant Zoho also announced the launch of 13 generative AI application extensions and integrations powered by ChatGPT. However the growth of Gen AI will also have an impact on the workforce and companies will have to invest in training and upskilling Garg said in the media briefing. E-commerce startup Dukaans founder Suumit Shah faced huge flak online after he wrote about replacing 90 percent of his customer support team with an AI chatbot that went viral on Twitter. We had to lay off 90% of our support team because of this AI chatbot. Tough Yes. Necessary Absolutely Shah wrote. However Garg also said that for India to tap the Gen AI opportunity there are factors like Government Support in terms of making capital and public data goods available for enterprises. This lofty vision requires concerted efforts from key stakeholders: industry associations government investors across stages and corporations. Each plays a unique role with specific actions that can power the Indian SaaS ecosystem Garg said. Macroeconomic pressure to have a short-term impact on SaaS demand Navigating the current complex macro-economic climate with multiple global disruptions and rapid technological changes will require founders to build a mix of offensive and defensive moves the report said The Russia-Ukraine war and its impact on supply chains high inflation rates and the US Federal Reserves aggressive interest rate hikes are causing fears of a recession in the US adding to the sectors worries. In fact large SaaS firms have undertaken layoffs and cut down on their marketing and other spending drastically to brace for the macro pressures. SaaS major Freshworks undertook at least three rounds of performance-based layoffs while many other SaaS firms like Zoho have cut down on hirings including placement hirings. There is definitely a bit of slowdown as the macroeconomic environment is not in favour of the companies yet we are seeing growth. For 2030 we even took a conservative approach to say that we will grow by around 30-40% and reach $50 billion of revenues but things may change Garg said.',\n",

While debate will continue over whether generative AI replaces more jobs than it creates Harvard professor Arthur Brooks said at the CNBC Work Summit that AI wont so much eliminate jobs as disassemble them and put them back together again in new iterations. In this wave of automation white-collar work is among the most exposed to the threat of AI  and is in the least going to be re-made in ways that are first now being seen in early office experimentation. PwC is rolling out its customized ChatPwC for 75000 workers in North America this month. The hyperbole around AI is more than I have seen with anything in 30 years but its well-earned. It will change everything PwC chief products  technology officer Joe Atkinson recently told CNBC. PwC opened its internal AI factory a year ago and within six weeks the firm had more than 3000 use cases for internal uses and clients and very few dont have merit he said adding that many also came from individual contributors rather than leaders. McKinsey has created its own AI platform called Lilli that is being deployed among 45000 employees and enables consultants to do in minutes what it would have taken them weeks to do said CFO Eric Kutcher said at the recent CNBC CFO Council Summit in Washington D.C. None of this is any surprise to Chavez who says professional services firms might be saying How am I going to defend business against AI but that would be a mistake. They should he says be asking how they can automate large swaths of tasks and reconceive what it means to deliver those services. And he has similar career advice for workers. Chavez said he sees three career strategies for navigating AI which he typically shares with young people. The three AI career options simply explained The first career option Chavez said is to tell the computers what to do. Be a computer scientist or engineer. Its interesting. The second option a fantastic strategy open to lots and lots of people Chavez said is to collaborate with the people who tell computers what to do and use the computers and tools to make yourself much more productive. I saw lots of people on Wall Street adopt that strategy Chavez said. They helped to automate the trading so they could go on and do higher level things and those people have fantastic careers. The third option and the only one he does not recommend to anyone is to stand in way of progress in the name of job security and obfuscate or thwart people looking to automate workflows. Its doomed to fail Chavez said. Ive seen it fail. Do not set yourself up in competition with the computers. I decided in seventh grade to not compete with calculators on multiplying numbers. I had confidence finding what tools can do better will open up new things for me to do. His advice for companies was similar. Boards and leadership of companies need to look at all of their businesses look at all their different workflows from one end to the other and if in your business you have a workflow that has these features: its routine its repeated  it takes as inputs all kinds of disparate data  PDFs and Excels and unstructured web pages and voice  and its output is customized maybe heavily customized and somewhat but maybe not wildly creative  if youve got a workflow that meets those filters its one you really ought to be looking at right now with the AI tools on the market and consider whether you can give your people a force multiplier. watch now VIDEO 4:47 04:47 AI is going to make all of us more productive says Sixth Streets Marty Chavez Closing Bell: Overtime To join the CNBC Workforce Executive Council apply at cnbccouncils.com/wec .',\n",

       " 'headline: AI chatbots can hallucinate and make things upwhy it happens and how to spot it.  content: When you hear the word hallucination you may think of hearing sounds no one else seems to hear or imagining your coworker has suddenly grown a second head while youre talking to them. But when it comes to artificial intelligence hallucination means something a bit different. When an AI model hallucinates it generates fabricated information in response to a users prompt but presents it as if its factual and correct. Say you asked an AI chatbot to write an essay on the Statue of Liberty. The chatbot would be hallucinating if it stated that the monument was located in California instead of saying its in New York. But the errors arent always this obvious. In response to the Statue of Liberty prompt the AI chatbot may also make up names of designers who worked on the project or state it was built in the wrong year. This happens because large language models  commonly referred to as AI chatbots are trained on enormous amounts of data which is how they learn to recognize patterns and connections between words and topics. They use this knowledge to interpret prompts and generate new content such as text or photos. But since AI chatbots are essentially predicting the word that is most likely to come next in a sentence they can sometimes generate outputs that sound correct but arent actually true. A real-world example of this occurred when lawyers representing a client who was suing an airline submitted a legal brief written by ChatGPT to a Manhattan federal judge. The chatbot included fake quotes and cited non-existent court cases in the brief. AI chatbots are becoming increasingly more popular and OpenAI even lets users build their own customized ones to share with other users. As we begin to see more chatbots on the market understanding how they work  and knowing when theyre wrong  is crucial. In fact hallucinate in the AI sense is Dictionary.coms word of the year  chosen because it best represents the potential impact AI may have on the future of language and life. Hallucinate seems fitting for a time in history in which new technologies can feel like the stuff of dreams or fiction  especially when they produce fictions of their own a post about the word says. How Open AI and Google address AI hallucination Both OpenAI and Google warn users that their AI chatbots can make mistakes and advise them to double check their responses. Both tech organizations are also working on ways to reduce hallucination. Google says one way it does this is through user feedback. If Bard generates an inaccurate response users should click the thumbs-down button and describe why the answer was wrong so that Bard can learn and improve the company says. OpenAI has implemented a strategy called  process supervision . With this approach instead of just rewarding the system for generating a correct response to a users prompt the AI model would reward itself for using proper reasoning to arrive at the output. Detecting and mitigating a models logical mistakes or hallucinations is a critical step towards building aligned AGI [or artificial general intelligence] Karl Cobbe mathgen researcher at OpenAI told CNBC in May . And remember while AI tools like ChatGPT and Googles Bard can be convenient theyre not infallible. When using them be sure to analyze the responses for factual errors even if theyre presented as true.

       " 'headline: ChatGPT will help us with extremely hard problems in the future says OpenAIs chief tech officer.  content: Mira Murati wasnt always sure OpenAIs generative chatbot ChatGPT was going to be the sensation it has become. When she joined the artificial intelligence firm in 2018 AIs capabilities had expanded to being good at strategy games but the sort of language model people use today seemed a long way off. In 2019 we had GPT3 and there was the first time that we had AI systems that kind of showed some sense of language understanding. Before that we didnt think it was really possible that AI systems would get this language understanding Murati now chief technology officer at OpenAI said onstage at the Atlantic Festival on Friday. In fact we were really skeptical that was the case. What a difference a few years makes. These days users are employing ChatGPT in a litany of ways to enhance their personal and professional lives . The rate of technological progress has been incredibly steep Murati said. The climb continues. Heres what Murati said to expect from ChatGPT as the technology continues to develop. Youll be able to actually chat with chatbots You may soon be able to interact with ChatGPT without having to type anything in Murati said. We want to move further away from our current interaction she said. Were sort of slaves to the keyboard and the touch mechanism of the phone. And if you really think about it that hasnt really been revolutionized in decades. Murati envisions users being able to talk with ChatGPT the same way they might chat with a friend or a colleague. That is really the goal  to interact with these AI systems in a way thats actually natural in a way that youd collaborate with someone and its high bandwidth she said. You could talk in text and just exchange messages  or I could show an image and say Hey look I got all these business cards when I was in these meetings. Can you just put them in my contacts list It remains to be seen what kind of hardware could make these sorts of interactions possible though former Apple designer Jony Ives is reportedly in advanced talks with OpenAI to produce a consumer product meant to be the iPhone of artificial intelligence. AI will think on deeper levels In its current iteration AI chatbots are good at collaborating with humans and responding to our prompts. The goal says Murati is to have the bots think for themselves. Were trying to build [a] generally intelligent system. And whats missing right now is new ideas Murati said. With a completely new idea like the theory of general relativity you need to have the capability of abstract thinking. And so thats really where were going  towards these systems that will eventually be able to help us with extremely hard problems. Not just collaborate alongside us but do things that today were not able to do at all. The everyday ChatGPT user isnt looking to solve the mysteries of the universe but one upshot of improving these systems is that chatbots should grow more and more accurate. When asked if ChatGPT would be able to produce answers on par with Wikipedia Murati said It should do better than that. It should be more scientific-level accuracy. With bots that can think through answers users should be able to really trace back the pieces of information ideally or at least understand why through reasoning sort of like a chain of thought understand why the system got to the answer she said. Revolution is coming to the way we learn and work Murati acknowledged that evolving AI technology will likely disrupt the way that Americans learn and work  a shift that will come with risks and opportunities. Murati noted that students have begun using AI chatbots to complete assignments for them. In response she says In many ways well probably have to change how we teach. While AI opens the door for academic dishonesty it also may be a unique teaching tool she said. Right now youve got a teacher in a classroom of 30 students [and] its impossible to customize the learning the information to how they best learn Murati said. And this is what AI can offer. It can offer this personalized tutor that customizes learning and teachings to you to how you best perceive and understand the world. Similar disruption may be coming to workplaces where there is widespread fear that AI may be taking the place of human employees. Some jobs will be created but just like every major revolution I think a lot of jobs will be lost. There will be maybe probably a bigger impact on jobs than in any other revolution and we have to prepare for this new way of life says Murati. Maybe we work much less. Maybe the workweek changes entirely. No matter what the revolution is coming . And it will be up to the public and the people who govern us to determine how and how much the AI revolution affects our lives. I know theres a lot of engagement right now with D.C. on these topics and understanding the impact on workforce and such but we dont have the answers Murati said. Were gonna have to figure them out along the way and I think it is going to require a lot of work and thoughtfulness.

       " 'headline: Hollywood writers fear losing work to AI.  content: Hollywood screenwriter Michelle Amor says she is fearful about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on her livelihood. I dont want to be replaced with something artificial. Ms Amor and fellow US television and film writers have now been on strike since the start of May. One of their key demands is that the studios and streaming giants agree to limits on the future use of AI-powered writing tools such as ChatGPT. The writers and their union - the Writers Guild of America - want it in writing that AI can only be used for research purposes and not to ever replace them. My mothers union job as a packer for 35 years was replaced with robotics says Ms Amor who currently has two TV projects in development - The Honorable and PG County. Thats understandable because its a labour intensive job but we create art. Who wants a fake Picasso Ms Amor who says she is adamantly against the use of AI in screenwriting adds: We writers are the heart and soul of this entire industry. No-one works until we do - everyone knows it. Fellow screenwriter Melissa Rundle says she was shocked at how quickly ChatGPT became a core issue of the ongoing labour dispute. I was surprised at first because Chat GPT appeared seemingly out of nowhere - but as soon as I became more familiar with its ever-increasing capabilities it became a concern says Ms Rundle. She has written TV series Kung FU and the movie Cup Of Love among numerous other projects. Its likely here to stay and we need to cope with the disruption. Writers are not trying to stop progress - were just trying to build in some basic protections against employers who have proven time and time again they wont hesitate to exploit us if given the chance. Ms Rundle continues: At a minimum we are fighting for regulated use of AI on projects and a firm understanding that it cannot write - or re-write - any literary material. Nor can it be used as a source material either. I saw a great sign on the picket lines that read AI doesnt have childhood trauma and this is truly important. As writers we are creating stories that touch people and oftentimes digging deep into our soul - this is storytelling at its most sacred and should never be robbed by a machine. Elliott Kalan is a comedian and screenwriter whose credits include The Daily Show With Jon Stewart and Mystery Science Theater 3000. He says that one of the biggest challenges writers now face is the threat of studio executives using AI to generate original ideas for movies or TV series. Rather than buying an original screenplay or television series or even hiring a writer to adapt an existing work into a new medium theyll try to have a computer program spit out ideas for shows or movies - then pay a writer a small amount to rework it and make it presentable and interesting says Mr Kalan. If that happens writers will lose a lot of the compensation they should be receiving for their ideas and their work as well as losing the chance to really contribute something meaningful to audiences. Nevertheless Mr Kalan can see the potential for AI to help writers. Ideally AI should remain an optional tool used for organising information - or for communicating ideas. AI raises hard important creative and legal questions for everyone says Scott Rowe a spokesperson for The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. This is the trade association that represents the studios and streamers such as Warner Bros Discovery Disney Netflix and Apple. Were creative companies and we value the work of creatives says Rowe. The best stories are original insightful and often come from peoples own experiences. For example writers want to be able to use the new AI technology as part of their creative process without changing how credits are determined which is complicated given AI material cant be copyrighted. So its something that requires a lot more discussion which weve committed to doing. Chun Xia is a founding partner of Silicon Valley-based technology investment firm TSVC. He envisages a future where sitcom writers use AI-generated scripts as a foundation for further development. AI algorithms will analyse existing scripts comedic patterns and audience responses to generate content with comedic timing character dynamics and engaging storylines he says. Writers will then infuse their creative expertise adding their wit humour and original ideas to refine the AI-generated material. He adds that this collaborative process between AI and human writers will optimize comedic impact pacing and character development. Through this iterative approach AI will provide data-driven insights that aid in creating resonant storylines for the target audience. Ultimately the integration of AI-generated content and human creativity will lead to enhanced sitcom scripts that maintain their unique voice while benefiting from the AI-generated insights. A simple guide to help you understand AI Experts propose rules for safe usage WATCH: What threat does AI pose John Pollono a writer director and actor is not impressed with the suggestion that AI can be used to write the first drafts of scripts. He says that the idea of AI scouring all past movie scripts to inform future ones is messed up and incestual. It is like using the same playdough over and over again. Mr Pollono who has written the screenplay for upcoming comedy crime movie Riff Raff which will star actors Jennifer Coolidge and Brian Cox adds that writers are at risk of having their voices robbed. However fellow screenwriter Sara Bibel says AI will never be any good at creative writing. Its a glorified auto-correct that throws together random combinations of words based on coding says Ms Bibel whose writing credits include long-running US TV series The Young  The Restless. All it does is plagiarize what has been fed into the system and is not capable of writing anything.',\n",
       " 'headline: Why teaching robots to blink is hard but important.  content: Its my first time drumming along with a robot. Im sitting across a table from an adorable humanoid robot called the iCub. We each have our own stick and box and are meant to strike the box with the stick in sync with a light pattern. But of course Im also watching the robot - and Im aware that its watching me. This drumming experiment has been designed to test how the presence of a robot doing the same task affects a humans behaviour. Its one of many experiments of human-robot interaction being carried out by the research group CONTACT (Cognitive Architecture for Collaborative Technologies) at the Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa. Though Im aware of the lights and the other people in the room my gaze keeps being drawn to the iCubs heavy white eyelids. For one thing theres a noticeable noise when the robot blinks every few seconds. And because this childlike robot has expressive oversized eyes its gaze is compelling. This matters because with blinking as with other aspects of eye gaze theres more than strictly meets the eye. While it is often assumed that blinking is just a reflexive physiological function associated with protective functions and ocular lubrication it also serves an important role in reciprocal interaction comments Helena Kiilavuori a psychology researcher at the University of Tampere in Finland. Human blinking conveys attention and emotion. As a means of non-verbal communication it expresses a number of things we arent consciously aware of such as who should take a turn in a conversation. Thus its just one of many social signals humans exchange constantly without being aware of them yet while deriving a great deal of information and comfort from them. So social roboticists have been studying both the physical and psychological properties of human blinking to understand why it might be useful to match it in robots. Due to the many important functions of blinking in human behaviour it could be assumed that having robots blinking their eyes could significantly enhance their perceived human-likeness. This could in turn facilitate human-robot interaction says Ms Kiilavuori. Put another way When the robots blinking wellpeople feel for your character says David Hanson who leads Hanson Robotics. Indeed CONTACT research with 13-year-olds and adults in Italy shows that both groups simply like blinking robots more . An unblinking robot can give a person the unpleasant impression of being stared at points out Alessandra Sciutti who leads the CONTACT unit. Humans also perceive robots that blink more naturally as more intelligent . And intelligence matters in situations where humans depend on robots to provide information such as in train stations. Despite the benefits of natural-looking blinking integrating it into robots (apart from avatars and robots with screen displays for faces) is technically challenging. Blinks are one of the subtlest of human movements so designing mechanisms that can mimic these movements require advanced technology such as high-precision motors Ms Kiilavuori explains. The roboticists at Engineered Arts for example use expensive aerospace-grade motors as well as designing their own control electronics. Specifically says Mr Hanson of Hanson Robotics The speed of the motors moving skin material when blinking is really challenging and making the shape of the eye look natural while blinking is happening is also challenging. As well as reducing friction between artificial eyelids and the eye surface itself. Another issue here is a trade-off between the speed and sound of motorised blinking. Francesco Rea a senior technician at the CONTACT unit says that in the iCub robot a quieter motor could dampen the sound of a blink. But the slower movement then makes the robot look sleepy or catlike. Very slow blinks also risk a loss of visual information as the iCubs camera is located behind the eyes. In vision missing two frames is not that big an issue says Mr Rea. Missing ten frames starts to be an issue. Ms Kiilavuori adds Another challenge is the correct timing and duration of blinks. The different functions that blinking performs - such as how a person changes blinking speed while telling a lie - involve different eyelid dynamics as well as different emotional states. Any deviation from the natural and appropriate blinking times and duration in a given context can make the robot appear odd and disturbing she says. More technology of business: Why there is serious money in kitchen fumes The tech entrepreneur betting he can get younger How LinkedIn is changing and why some are not happy The tiny diamond sphere central to a fusion breakthrough The remote Swedish town leading the green steel race The CONTACT team use a software program that partially randomises the intervals between single and double blinking. After all blinking fixedly wouldnt look very natural either. Over at Disney Research roboticists have joined forces with character animators to develop a research prototype for realistic robotic gaze. The aim is to design an expressive system of eye gaze that is easy for animators to control in order to convey subtle emotion. With elements like motion curves of eyelids we can kind of isolate these individual behaviours which makes it much easier to really concentrate on getting small aspects and small details correct says James Kennedy a research scientist at Disney Research. Theyve patented their system of robotic sensing and control of eye gaze. This includes software for processing images taken by a camera in the robots chest and generating control signals for movements like opening and closing the eyelids. Mr Kennedy says that the research remains more experimental and isnt yet being applied in Disneys theme parks. The goal here was to really select a single social cue that we were interested in and push it as far as we could in making lifelike believable motion and behaviourthat we felt would provide a platform for engagement with people. The technology would need to be refined in order for instance for the eye gaze system to remain believable in longer close-up interactions with humans . Another general challenge would be getting humanoid robots to begin syncing their blinking patterns to those of humans as humans do in conversation. These types of challenges remain compelling to some roboticists. And contrary to exaggerated pop culture depictions of androids that are indistinguishable from humans blinking is one tiny example of the many complexities that still keep robotic interactions from seeming completely natural. When trying to replicate a mechanism as tiny and sometimes underappreciated as blinking actually you reveal how complex this mechanism is and then how much subtle movement there is notes Mr Kennedy. And thats where we have this really great opportunity for exploration and invention.',\n",
       " 'headline: The workers already replaced by artificial intelligence.  content: Until recently Dean Meadowcroft was a copywriter in a small marketing department. His duties included writing press releases social media posts and other content for his company. But then late last year his firm introduced an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system. At the time the idea was that it would be working alongside human lead copywriters to help speed up the process essentially streamline things a little bit more he says. Mr Meadowcroft was not particularly impressed with the AIs work. It just kind of made everybody sound middle of the road on the fence and exactly the same and therefore nobody really stands out. The content also had to be checked by human staff to make sure it had not been lifted from anywhere else. But the AI was fast. What might take a human copywriter between 60 and 90 minutes to write the AI could do in 10 minutes or less. Around four months after the AI was introduced Mr Meadowcrofts four-strong team was laid off. Mr Meadowcroft cant be certain but hes pretty sure the AI replaced them. I did laugh-off the idea of AI replacing writers or affecting my job until it did he said. The latest wave of AI hit late last year when OpenAI launched ChatGPT. Backed by Microsoft ChatGPT can give human-like responses to questions and can in minutes generate essays speeches even recipes. Other tech giants are scrambling to launch their own systems - Google launched Bard in March . While not perfect such systems are trained on the ocean of data available on the internet - an amount of information impossible for even a team of humans to digest. So thats left many wondering which jobs might be at risk. More technology of business: Can Amsterdam make the circular economy work The exploding demand for giant heat pumps The chip maker that became an AI superpower Why car parks are the hottest space in solar power Proteins power is being uncovered and unleashed Earlier this year a report from Goldman Sachs said that AI could potentially replace the equivalent of 300 million full-time jobs. Any job losses would not fall equally across the economy. According to the report 46% of tasks in administrative and 44% in legal professions could be automated but only 6% in construction and 4% in maintenance. The report also points out that the introduction of AI could boost productivity and growth and might create new jobs. There is some evidence of that already. This month IKEA said that since 2021 i t has retrained 8500 staff who worked in its call centres as design advisers. The furniture giant says that 47% of customer calls are now handled by an AI called Billie. While IKEA does not see any job losses resulting from its use of AI such developments are making many people worried. A recent survey by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) which polled 12000 workers from around the world found that a third were worried that they would be replaced at work by AI with frontline staff more concerned than managers. Jessica Apotheker from BCG says thats partly due to fear of the unknown. When you look at leaders and managers we have more than 80% of them that use AI at least on a weekly basis. When you look at frontline staff that number drops to 20% so with the lack of familiarity with the tech comes much more anxiety and concern on the outcomes for them. But perhaps there is good reason to be anxious. For three months last year Alejandro Graue had been doing voiceover work for a popular YouTube channel. It seemed to be a promising line of work a whole YouTube channel in English had to be re-voiced in Spanish. Mr Graue went on holiday late last year confident that there would be work when he returned. I was expecting to have that money to live with - I have two daughters so I need the money he says. But to his surprise before he returned to work the YouTube channel uploaded a new video in Spanish - one he had not worked on. When I clicked on it what I heard was not my voice but an AI generated voice - a very badly synced voiceover. It was terrible. And I was like What is this Is this like going to be my new partner in crime like the channel Or is this going to replace me he says. A phone call to the studio he worked for confirmed the worst. The client wanted to experiment with AI because it was cheaper and faster. That experiment turned out to be a failure. Viewers complained about the quality of the voiceover and eventually the channel took down the videos that featured the AI-generated voice. But Mr Graue did not find that very comforting. He thinks the technology will only improve and wonders where that will leave voiceover artists like him. If this starts to happen in every job that I have what should I do Should I buy a farm I dont know. What other job could I look for that is not going to be replaced as well in the future Its very complicated he says. If AI is not coming for your job then it is likely you might have to start working with one in some way. After a few months of freelance work former copywriter Dean Meadowcroft took a new direction. He now works for an employee assistance provider which gives wellbeing and mental health advice to staff. Working with AI is now part of his job. I think that is where the future is for AI giving quick access to human-led content as opposed to completely eliminating that human aspect he says.

The TUC said the UK had no plans like the EUs AI Act to regulate its use in hiring firing and setting work conditions. The union has asked a taskforce to draft legal protections. The government said it was committed to improving and upholding worker rights. It comes as the boss of Octopus Energy told the BBC its customers prefer emails written by AI over his staff.

Mary Towers employment rights policy officer at the TUC said: The types of decisions that are being made by AI are significant and life changing - for example who should get a job how work is carried out where its carried out. A lack of AI specific legislation meant the UK was being left behind she said. For example in the EU they are in the process of passing an AI Act. In this country we dont have any equivalent. Prefer AI to humans At Octopus Energy AI is used to read interpret and answer customer service queries. Chief executive Greg Jackson said it was doing work that would otherwise need an extra 250 people. He said customers appeared to prefer dealing with the AI than with a human. An email written by our team members has a 65% satisfaction rating from customers he said. An email written by AI has an 80 or 85% satisfaction rating. And so what the AI is doing is enabling our team to do a better job of serving customers at a time of great need. He added that a human commanding an AI to write an email saves a lot of tedious typing. But we have to ensure this is all done responsibly. And we need governments and economists and businesses to be ensuring that were doing this by enhancing and creating jobs not replacing them. Better health outcomes AI could lead to huge breakthroughs in science and medicine according to the boss of drug giant GSK. Emma Walmsley told the BBC that the speed with which AI could process data and see patterns would revolutionise drug development. Biopharma is difficult. It takes sometimes a decade billions [of pounds] and it has a 90% failure rate she said. But we are in the business of data at the heart of what we do. AI is helping us see things in this data faster. She said this meant drug and vaccine discovery and development should become more predictive and improve our probability of success. And she said that could mean better health outcomes for hundreds of millions of people. One in three of us is going to be battling with dementia there are still many cancers that dont have have solutions infectious diseases are still causing one in six deaths in the world she said. There was no doubt that AI would help us unlock better solutions to these challenges she said. And thats got to be something worth investing in with optimism whilst regulating responsibly. Ms Walmsley thinks improving productivity through the use of AI will create more jobs and change some jobs quite meaningfully. I think some will need maybe some less headcount on but therell be other spaces where we need a lot more she said. It is sometimes assumed that the creative arts will be the least affected by AI as machine learning will struggle to replicate human creativity. But thats wrong according to actress and voice over artist Laurence Bouvard who said that AI is being used to sample analyse and replicate human voices without paying the original artist. When we do a job in order to get paid we have to sign away all our rights she said. And these AI companies are just taking it without asking who it belongs to. She said AI was a particular threat to the army of lesser known artists who voice cartoons video games dictionaries and other audio work who could see their careers totally destroyed. A writer and an artist and a photographer even if their work is stolen they can create new work. If my voice is stolen if my career is over she said. Urgent action AI has great power and is already changing industries and the work place. Last week the OECD said the world was on the cusp of an AI revolution. The Paris-based body said: Urgent action is required to make sure AI is used responsibly and in a trustworthy way in the workplace. With great power comes great responsibility - and it is not yet clear in the UK or internationally - who will or who should take on that responsibility. A government spokesperson said: AI is set to fuel growth and create new highly-paid jobs throughout the UK while allowing us to carry out our existing jobs more efficiently and safely. That is why we are working with businesses and regulators to ensure AI is used safely and responsibility in business settings. Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.

       " 'headline: Musk says his new AI chatbot has a little humour.  content: Elon Musk has launched an AI chatbot called Grok on his social media site X formerly Twitter but so far it is only available to selected users. In some important respects it is the best that currently exists he posted on X before its release. Mr Musk boasted that Grok loves sarcasm and would answer questions with a little humour. However early signs suggest it suffers from problems common to other artificial intelligence tools. Other models decline to respond to some questions for example providing criminal advice. But Mr Musk said Grok would answer spicy questions that are rejected by most other AI systems. In a demonstration of the new tool posted by Mr Musk  Grok was asked for a step-by-step guide to making cocaine. It responded just a moment while I pull up the recipe... because Im totally going to help you with that and listed generalised rather than useable information combined with sarcastic suggestions before warning against pursuing the idea. It struck a gleeful tone in reference to the trial of crypto-entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried but mistakenly suggested it took eight hours for the jury to deliver a guilty verdict when in fact they returned it in under five. Generative AI tools like Grok have been widely criticised for including basic errors while sounding highly convincing in their style of writing. What is AI and how does it work The team behind Grok xAI was launched in July drawing on talent from other AI research firms. It is a separate company but closely linked to Mr Musks other enterprises X and the electric car firm Tesla. Earlier this year Mr Musk said he wanted his version of AI to be a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe. Mr Musk said a major advantage of Grok was that it had access to up-to-date information from the X platform which set it apart from the launch versions of some rivals although increasingly up-to-date responses are available for paying customers with other AI tools. Grok is currently in a test or beta format but will later be available to paying subscribers of X. Mr Musk said late on Sunday that the chatbot would be built into the X app and be available as a standalone app. Elon Musk tells Rishi Sunak AI will put an end to work ChatGPT can now access up to date information Why are fewer women using AI than men Last week at the UKs AI summit Mr Musk conceded there were dangers associated with AI development. But he has also been a long-standing champion of the technology. He was a co-founder of the firm OpenAI which created ChatGPT the first AI tool made widely available last year. Microsoft has invested in OpenAI making the tool available on its platform. Since then Google launched its rival artificial intelligence (AI) model Bard and Meta has launched Llama. The tools are designed to use previously ingested information to generate text answers that sound as though a human has written them. Grok is a term coined by science fiction writer Robert A. Heinlein in his 1961 novel Stranger in a Strange Land. In it grokking was to empathise deeply with others. However xAI said Grok was modelled after the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams which started as a BBC radio series in the 1980s but was later remade in print and on film. xAI said Grok was intended to answer almost anything and far harder even suggest what questions to ask. Grok was a very early beta product - the best we could do with two months of training it added.',\n",
       " 'headline: Theres no way AI will completely replace human musicians says award-winning composerheres why.  content: In April of this year a creator called Ghostwriter released the song Heart On My Sleeve which used AI generated voices of singers The Weeknd and Drake. It was later submitted for a Grammy award . Based on how quickly the song went viral online and how convincingly AI was able to mimic two extremely popular entertainers you may be wondering if the future of music could be filled with more AI artists than human musicians. But you shouldnt worry too much about that becoming a reality says Joel Beckerman an award-winning television and film composer and co-founder of Made Music Studio . There is no way for the foreseeable future that AI will completely replace composers he tells CNBC Make It. And there are a couple of reasons why. 1. People connect with artists stories and songs When it comes to music people enjoy connecting with the artists stories as much as they appreciate the songs themselves Beckerman says. Take mega pop star Taylor Swift  for example. She has not only released hundreds of songs over the course of her career but she has also cultivated a community of fans that deeply identify with the themes of love heartbreak and growth she sings about . Although an AI tool may be able to replicate Swifts voice and even produce lyrics that are similar to hers the AI isnt capable of drawing from its own past relationships and life experiences for song inspiration the way Swift and other music artists can. AI may be able to come up with a really good composition but the question is whether or not there is some kind of meaningful story that gets told around that Beckerman says. 2. Its difficult to program creativity Generative AI models use a series of sophisticated algorithms to process vast amounts of training data so that they can then produce new text video audio or photo content. Thats how AI chatbots are able to respond to users requests. However since we have a pretty limited understanding of how humans develop creativity it would be pretty difficult to make an algorithm that could duplicate that process. If we do not have an mathematical understanding or a scientific understanding of what creates consciousness or creativity we have no mechanism to instill it in an artificial system says Theo Omtzigt chief technology officer at Lemurian Labs. AI tools may still disrupt the music industry Although AI probably wont completely displace human musicians that doesnt mean the technology wont have an impact on the music industry. Rather than cranking out chart topping pop songs or Mozart-level orchestral masterpieces a more likely scenario is that AI tools will be able to create music that is good enough Beckerman says. For example this would be music that plays in the background of a minor scene at a bar during a movie or non-descript music that is played at a restaurant to add to the dining experience and set the mood. You dont need great music or wholly original music for that you just need good enough music he says. However since humans are typically paid to create the music used for those purposes theres a chance companies purchasing that type of music may choose to use an AI music generating tool instead. Beckerman is also concerned that AI music generating tools may make it more difficult for musicians to get started in the industry. Nobody is creating great music the first time they create music he says. So the question is how do people get better and better and better and better if theres no market for when they first get started Thats why it will continue to be important for musicians to build strong connections with their fan bases who value the uniquely human experiences that inspire their songs. Theres a richness to human stories and the connections between audience and artists that cannot be duplicated by AI Beckerman says.

       " 'headline: A new-year message from the CEO.  content: D ear friends and colleagues Happy New Year This time last year for the ninth year in a row I warned you that there had never been a more uncertain outlook for our business. My message this year is exactly the same only more so. The fog of unpredictability is again playing havoc with the clear skies of planning. We all know the term permacrisis. We have all heard of the acronym  VUCA  which stands for volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity. We all understand that the fourth industrial revolution is upon us. But my belief is that these three great forces have come together in an age of what I am christening permavucalution. It is my contention that three big permavucalutionary trends are at work. One is artificial intelligence. This technology will turbocharge the pace of change. Dont just take my word for it. The World Economic Forum thinks so too. AI is so disruptive that it may end up disrupting disruption itself. If you are struggling to make sense of that sentence dont worry: you are not alone. I have appointed Denise Laplange to head up our new Project for Rapid AI peRformance Improvement and Enhancement. I know you will make Denise feel very welcome. She and the PRAIRIE team will give us a full update on their plans for our use of AI later in January. For now though I urge you to embrace this technology in your own work. I often use Chat GPT to say no to conference invitations for example or to give generic responses to really unimportant emails. I want you to follow my example. Lets Experiment. Lets Explore. Lets Tinker. Lets EET . We need to get our arms around AI or we risk reaping a whirlwind of chickens coming home to roost. I know some of you are worried by what AI might mean for your own futures. I say to you: you cannot make an omelette without breaking some eggs. What if you dont like omelettes you reply Thats just ridiculous: who doesnt like omelettes Anyway I want to reassure you: AI is a way to make us all better at what we do. It is not likely to be the precursor to immediate large-scale lay-offs. The second permavucalutionary trend is climate change. At COP 28 I had a chance to speak to some actual people who are living with the consequences of global warming. That experience was humbling and inspiring: it made me realise we have to do more in this area. As a company we are making every effort to reduce our own carbon footprint but action is never enough. We also need to be part of the conversation. Thats why Im so pleased today to announce the launch of our new whatdoyousee marketing campaign. When I look in the mirror I dont just see a highly successful executive someone who is driven to make the most of himself every day. I also see a father an ex-husband a brother a Peloton rider a vintage-car collector and a citizen of Earth. What do you see Please post your own reflectionspun very much intendedon social media. You can also send me an email (and see how I incorporate Chat GPT into my work). The third manifestation of the permavucalution is a shortage of talent. By talent Im not talking about employees in general. Im talking about the right type of employeespeople who are willing to take big bets who go the extra mile who see opportunity where others see nothing but extreme danger. Im talking about some of you. I have mentioned how uncertain and volatile everything is. That means we have to sprint to stand still. But thats not all. To respond to constant changes we also need the agility of a mountain goat. And to spot those changes coming we require the radar of a bat. Now just ask yourself this question: have you ever seen a sprinting goat-bat That tells you something about the scale of the challenge that we all face. I know that this level of uncertainty can be disorientating even frightening. But if we do not think outside the box and push the envelope we will never be able to capture lightning in a bottle. Finally my usual plea: be humble. I have coined a brand new term in this message but I am not doing so for fame or recognition as a deep thinker. I know I dont have all the answers. If I have a great idea I dont just plough ahead with it. I ask my direct reports whether they think it is a great idea first and only when they agree that it is do I act. Have the humility to follow my example and this company will not just survive the age of permavucalution. It will thrive. Heres to 2024 Stew Pidd CEO .',\n",
       " 'headline: Can artificial intelligence help you get fit.  content: With a great many of us now trying to lose weight as a New Years resolution can artificial intelligence (AI) personal trainers replace human ones Id never set foot in a gym before says Varan Bhanot the chief executive of AI fitness software firm Magic AI. I found it too intimidating. Its also very expensive and inconvenient when youve got to travel to get there. When Mr Bhanot was told a few years back that he needed to lose weight or face health problems he transformed his life with the help of a personal trainer - a human one. But it dawned on Mr Bhanot that advice from an AI fitness chatbot available to people in their own homes could make a healthy lifestyle more accessible. So in 2021 he set up Magic AI. Its main product the Magic Mirror is a touch-screen mirror that also plays a video of an AI-powered trainer in human form. When you log in you put in all of your biometric information and then the AI generates a personalised programme just like a human personal trainer says Mr Bhanot. The AI trainer can talk to you via loudspeakers and using cameras to track your workout movements it offers instant feedback and suggestions. As you progress it devises new workouts. It comes as the use of AI in the global fitness and wellbeing sectors is continuing to soar. One report estimated that the market was worth $7.8bn (6.1bn) in 2022 and forecasted that the value would to jump to $35.6bn by 2030. The number of fitness apps that use AI is multiplying and includes Aaptiv FitnessAI Fitbod Freeletics VI Trainer and Whoop. Meanwhile some people are said to be simply asking popular AI chatbot ChatGPT to devise workouts for them. The rise in AI-powered fitness apps suggests that some people feel more comfortable interacting with a computer than they do with a human. While for others it might just be about the convenience of having a fitness coach in their pocket. But can AI really replicate the motivation that comes from human interaction Pilates teacher and physiotherapist Esther Fox doesnt think so. People want to speak to somebody they know and trust she says. AI is not something I would particularly want to use. The way to get results Ms Fox says is by connecting with people. When people feel heard and understood they listen to you - and they do what you want she says. Its a very human experience. Theres a lot of emotional intelligence that goes into health and fitness that you just cant replace with AI. By contrast British sprinter and Olympic bronze medal winner Desiree Henry is one of the voices and bodies of the AI trainers that appear on the screen of the Magic AI fitness mirrors. Even if youre doing a home workout alone it feels like someone is supporting you through the session she says. Mr Bhanot says that the idea is not to replace gyms but to work alongside them like Netflix and cinema food delivery and restaurants. AI offers another option for people who value flexibility and convenience. While most AI fitness apps are designed as a solitary pursuit now the first gym has opened where people can exercise together all trained by AI coaches. Read additional stories on artificial intelligence In Lumin Fitness darkened studio space in Dallas Texas LED screens line the walls from where AI personal trainers guide up to 14 gym goers at a time through personalised workouts or high-intensity interval training. Each person has their own designated station where a screen masks sensors that track both the motions of the exerciser as well as the gyms specially built equipment including dumbbells medicine balls and skipping ropes. They then get verbal feedback from the AI via headphones. Sensors in the studio can watch every member of the class monitoring form and giving feedback on every movement says Brandon Bean co-founder and chief executive of Lumin fitness. However a human trainer is also in the room. Were not trying to replace the talent of the trainers adds Mr Bean. Were giving them tools to provide a better experience. The coach is so important in building a community. Those in person high-fives the smiles. There are certain things you cant replicate. Physiotherapist Lucy McDonald says that if AI is programmed properly then I can see a huge amount of potential for it to help people to progress their exercises. However she cautions that AI might not always get things right and so people should still check with a human expert before they risk over-training or injury. Mr Bean argues that AI fitness apps will only continue to improve. From an industry perspective were very early on he says. But one of the brilliant features of AI is its ability to learn. Its not perfect now but as it learns over time AI fitness will get better and better.',\n",
       " 'headline: 10 Generative AI Predictions For 2024.  content: SUMMARY No technology is real and future-proof till enterprise adoption kicks in and when it comes to GenAI this is yet to happen believe investors that are actively focussing on emerging AI models AI For India is likely manifest as an extension of the existing digital public infrastructure push from the Indian government which has lifted Indias digital quotient to a great extent in the past two decades Investors watching the space believe Indian startups have a better opportunity to innovate in the infrastructure and application layers of GenAI but high capital requirements remain a big constraint FOLLOW US FOLLOW US The end of 2023 was something of an anti-climax for AI. Especially after a year where you could pretty much not avoid generative AI OpenAI ChatGPT and everything else that came with being in the so-called next generation of technology. And of course Indian startups jumped on to the generative AI bandwagon swiftly. But by the end of 2023 perhaps everyone was just a tad tired of the trite takes or as one investor told us the end of 2023 was the end of AI as a fad. After 12 months of the best ChatGPT prompts and look what Midjourney is capable of perhaps 2024 is the year that generative AI grows up. That is an odd thing to say for something so new but like any other technology that came before it generative AI needs to mature and 2024 is expected to be the real coming of age which will be led by enterprises before this maturity seeps into the Indian startup ecosystem. Of course we also had IT services giants in India announcing plans to invest in GenAI. Infosys tied up with Google Cloud to develop enterprise AI solutions and the debate about machines and software taking human jobs turned all too real. But this is just the beginning of the GenAI era. 10 Generative AI Predictions For Indian Startups In 2024 One of the things I say is that no technology is real and future-proof till enterprise adoption kicks in and when it comes to GenAI this is yet to happen. So watch out for this in 2024 according to Naganand Doraswamy founder of Ideaspring Capital adding that enterprise adoption is bound to happen as data silos break down. In other words enterprise adoption is not really a trend its just a matter of time before it happens. And its only after this that Indian startups will look at generative AI seriously since enterprise revenue often dictates new-age models. At the moment the enterprise consideration is on the buy-vs-build lines where enterprise data is still largely in silos despite the data revolution that preceded the GenAI moment. Aside from this what can we expect from the world of generative AI in 2024 Here are 10 predictions (ironic we know) of the trends that will shape GenAI in India in the year ahead. High-Level Talks For Global AI Regulations Will Begin To Crystallise Ever since we first heard about AI there have been concerns raised about the rise of machines the impact on human jobs and of course the danger of decision-making becoming less humane and more mechanical. And with generative AI rising these concerns have grown louder. Zoho cofounder and CEO Sridhar Vembu took up the mantle in 2023 in a public letter co-signed by Rajiv Kumar (former NITI Aayog vice-chairman) and Sharad Sharma (cofounder tof iSPIRT Foundation). Noting that AI could put millions of jobs at risk overnight the open letter said that adopting new technologies such as AI without appropriate safeguards could cause unprecedented disruption of the existing social order. AI has significantly impacted the employment sector in India since it has helped automate several tasks leading to job displacement said Jaideep Kewalramani COO at TeamLease Edtech. He added that it is also creating new opportunities in AI-related fields which can be an advantage for Indias base of engineers. The signs of human roles being replaced by generative AI are evident in the Indian startup ecosystem. And there is some backlash already. The founder of a Bengaluru-based ecommerce tech company learnt this when he claimed to have let go of his customer support team after using ChatGPT tools. Larger companies like Paytm are also choosing to use AI applications to replace human roles when the fintech giant laid off 1000 employees in December 2023. But when it comes to actual legislation there is a lot of ground to cover to prevent large-scale impact on startup jobs and other tech roles. The Indian government has said that since AI is a global development laws and regulations need to be more inclusive in nature. This is where the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) could play a role in 2024. A forum of 28 nations and the European Union (EU) the GPAI is looking to understand the challenges and opportunities in AI and promote responsible evolution. As chair of GPAI India hosted the annual summit in December and at the time Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that India will launch an AI mission so that small companies and startups get the required help and access to resources. In late 2023 the EU rolled out the worlds first legislation aimed at regulating the use of AI. In 2024 many nations would be eyeing the EU model to create nation-specific AI laws similar to how GDPR was used as a model for personal data laws. The Indian government is yet to announce any timelines for a national AI law we expect more urgency on this front in 2024. One can also foresee more high-level talks around global AI regulations as GenAI becomes more mainstream and as adoption grows across large and smaller companies. Generative AI Will Become A Key Battlefront In High-Profile Elections With key elections around the corner in the US and India its no surprise that lawmakers are keen on formulating AI rules as soon as possible. Misinformation is a major challenge in the run up to such major elections as we have seen in the past. If the 2015 US Presidential elections already turned the spotlight on misinformation (remember Cambridge Analytica) then generative AI is a whole new ballgame. India is slated to have the General Elections in mid-2024 and the US will also enter the Presidential election phase in the year. And while the use of technology has grown unabated in electoral campaigns generative AI poses an altogether new threat where no one can be sure about what is real and what is AI-generated. Already there has been some talk in India about social media platforms needing to clean up their act when it comes to GenAI content and we expect more pressure on intermediaries in the coming days as the election races heat up. In December 2023 the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) rolled out a new advisory to all social media platforms to comply with existing IT rules and ensure that deepfakes (AI-generated videos) and any related misinformation are curbed. The IT ministry has directed intermediaries to clearly and precisely inform users about what kind of content is prohibited. We do not know what twists and turns AI will bring to the race for power but we can say with some certainty that 2024 will see AI create a new paradigm for how elections are fought and won. Startups Will Bet Big On Ethical AI Models While elections and law enforcement are the primary focal point for the government and legislators there is also a parallel effort by tech startups to create what is being called Ethical AI or eAI. Its built around well-intentioned and well-defined ethical guidelines regarding what are considered fundamental internet rights  individual rights privacy non-discrimination and non-manipulation. US AI giant Anthropic is arguably the most high-profile example of a startup that has registered as a Benefit Corporation an example followed by Elon Musk when he launched xAI in late 2023. Being a benefit corp essentially means the company will prioritise being a benefit to society over its fiduciary duties to investors. For instance an incorporation filing for xAI says its general purpose is to create a material positive impact on society and the environment taken as a whole. Dont get this wrong: Ethical AI is still big business. Anthropic claims to have an ARR of $850 Mn in 2024 and raised more than $6 Bn in 2023. But again there is some debate about how Ethical AI companies are practising self-regulation which means one companys ethics may not exactly align with each other.

Ideasprings Doraswamy believes that unfortunately India still needs enriched data. Despite the internet growth of the past decade India is still a data-poor nation which makes it harder to make impactful models. For AI to truly have an ethical impact the key is health data education data and social data. Financial data currently has low AI applicability but without the key data pillars AI development in India will remain on the surface. Indian Language AI Models LLMs Will Pick Up Pace Funding While global regulations are well and good the bigger fish for many Indian startups will be the domestic business opportunity. In this regard AI For India has become a buzzword with mega launches ( Bhavish Aggarwals Krutrim SI ) and big seed rounds ( Sarvam AIs $41 Mn Series A ) signalling whats to come in 2024. According to Kushal Bhagia founder of All In Capital AI For India may manifest as an extension of the existing digital public infrastructure (DPI) push from the government. This is also likely to prioritise the development of large language models (LLMs) that are built around Indian languages and dialects. Indian language models will be a critical pillar of AI for India as non-English internet users outnumber English language users in the country. Google rolled out support for nine Indian languages for its GenAI chatbot Bard soon after OpenAI did the same for its ChatGPT app. India is a big focus area for these AI giants and naturally startups are eyeing their own piece in this melee. The India Stacks natural progression would be when processes like eKYCs signing up for schemes applying to entrance exams applying for permits/licences could be simplified by LLMs and generative AI. This could be enabled by public-private partnerships where fine-tuned models by private organisations can get data access for specific functions Bhagia added. Theres also the belief that while closed source models such as Sarvam AI may expedite model development for local purposes and regional dialects a bigger impetus is likely to come from global open source models which can be customised for India-specific use cases. Think of it like Android vs iOS. Open-source AI models are growing in popularity as startups race to compete with highly capitalised companies such as OpenAI or Cohere or Anthropic said another Bengaluru-based early stage investor adding that Indian companies which do not have access to large swathes of capital will likely rely on open source models. Bhagia added that Indian developers will be a major contributor to low-cost open source models which are a dark horse amid large models and could be tapped by generative AI startups in India. Apart from that model-level innovations in India will largely be toward regional language and dialects as current global models require a lot of [training] tokens for those when compared to English. Given its recent influence on Indian tech and startups everyone is keen to find out more about what Reliance is planning on this front as well. Recently Reliance Jio chairman Akash Ambani said that large language models (LLMs) and generative AI have barely scratched the surface of the emerging space. Jio is in early talks with IIT-Bombay for a BharatGPT programme and the company has plans to launch horizontal AI products across media commerce communication and devices verticals but there are specific products being planned for each vertical as well. Big Techs Dominance Will Manifest Through Acquisitions Why is GenAI so big right now The simple answer is big tech. And yes OpenAI is big tech in 2024. But like we saw in the cloud computing boom US-based tech giants have taken the lead in GenAI as well which leaves them best placed to dictate the future of the market. According to Prayank Swaroop partner at venture capital giant Accel the big companies in GenAI will keep getting bigger because thats the reality of the sector. If Googles Gemini AI model outperforms OpenAI in some tests and parameters theres no way OpenAI will let its lead slip. So the arms race is well and truly on. He added that unfortunately India will not see this kind of a war unless companies are actively fighting to acquire companies. There are haves and have-nots and he thinks India has more have-nots right now. Everybodys already using these models or they will use Llama if Facebook is generous enough and sticks to the open source model. But Meta has to really really support Llama in the long run. But even then that would be a US-imported technology and the gap is already widening Accels Swaroop added. Unfortunately for India the US GenAI giants have the lead on the bottom two fundamental layers of GenAI which is the hardware foundation and the LLMs. However Indian companies that are building the AI tooling fabric stand the chance to attract funding and acquisition bids from big tech giants. On the brighter side the application layer of GenAI is also an area where Indian startups that are building unique products have the best chance of competing with international companies. Areas such as generative audio or video have immense potential given that each market has specific needs and Indian startups can out compete international companies in these niches. Emergence Of Business Models Around LLM Ops On-Premise LLMs Speaking of new models and outcompeting international companies one area that Indian startups are currently exploring is LLM Ops and enterprise deployment of offline LLMs or on-premise LLMs for organisation-specific needs. But having to work with US-based companies means there is a higher incidence of Indian GenAI startups being registered in the US. In that sense GenAI startups are following the SaaS route to a certain extent. One example is Giga ML founded by Varun Vummadi and Esha Manideep Dinne which has raised funding from Y Combinator and Peak XV. The platform lets companies deploy LLMs on-premise  essentially cut off from the wider world  which it claims helps cut costs and preserve privacy of enterprise data. Registered in the US Its built on top of Metas open source Llama LLM and its primary goal isnt speed but data sanctity and user safety. Similarly theres Portkey.AI a startup that has built tools to allow businesses to monitor their LLM Ops connect to multiple LLMs to experiment improve and manage prompts effectively. It works with OpenAI Anthropic Langchain LlamaIndex among other LLMs and boasts of customers such as Postman Jio Haptik and Springworks. Founded in January 2023 by Rohit Agarwal and Ayush Garg the startup raised $3 Mn in its seed round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and its also registered in the US. Such models are emerging and while Indian entrepreneurs have found niches one area that still needs to be addressed is that Indian entrepreneurs are increasingly moving to the US to set up their startups. The situation is complicated for early-stage investors in AI especially those that have small ticket sizes. While the capital requirements for the infra and application layer are lower it is not easy to build in a lean manner in AI. As a result smaller seed funds have to either settle for smaller stakes while coinvesting with larger funds or basically take unnaturally big bets on a company that may not fit in their thesis according to Doraswamy of Ideaspring who largely invests in enterprise tech startups. Vertical Generative AI Will See A Breakout Year Will vertical generative AI be the answer to solving India-specific problems from India Some investors expect wider enterprise adoption to create a new generation of entrepreneurs that can address vertical problems in India rather than the global horizontal approach. Open source models of Mistral are already outperforming GPT3.5 in a few metrics however while they manage general tasks well they are inaccurate for specific tasks. Here Indian developers and startups will build lower cost fine-tuned models on top of global large models for vertically specific niche use cases. This will enable AI for India with our own data leveraging global resources added All In Capitals Bhagia. Accels Swaroop is similarly hopeful of Indian startups on the application and the infrastructure or fabric layer of generative AI. But here they are hamstrung by the lack of customer data of the kind that Freshworks or someone else has which is a big moat for larger companies. Even companies such as Sarvam AI which has raised $41 Mn already will need hundreds of millions of dollars to be able to build something and then the question remains how robust their model is in comparison to the US giants. Indian developers are not loyal to India and there is a brain drain problem in GenAI as well. Bhagia added that as pure-play models are generally expensive the early-stage firm anticipates more activity on the infra or tooling layer. He pointed to All Ins portfolio startups such as Segmind (model optimisation) or Supernova (AI tutor for kids) which received day zero investments from the firm. Indian startups have locally built and scaled SaaS for global markets. Similar patterns may play out in Generative AIs application layer too. There will be 3Cs for GenAI apps by India for the world  Creative tools Companionship and Copilots the All In Capital founder added. Marketing Tech Will Ride GenAI Surge While most startups are leveraging generative text and images to solve operational overheads one area that is likely to see a major boost in 2024 is generative video thanks to adoption in marketing and advertising. Typically generative video uses a lot of resources and requires millions of dollars to operationalise unless there is a big commercial drive. Hippo Video founder Karthi Mariappan told Inc42 earlier that hardware costs alone are very high for most startups because of how many discrete graphics processors are needed to generate AI video. The startup leverages AI models to create videos that help product teams amplify engagement around marketing content and promote AI avatars. Its [generative video] definitely capital intensive as of today. But we see that tapering down as more and more innovations come in. Now Nvidia is releasing data centres specific for Gen AI. So kind of a lot of innovations are happening on the DevOps front that can reduce the costs in the long run Mariappan said. AI-generated content has seen marketing applications on platforms such as MoEngage Clevertap Pepper Content and others. This is most likely to trickle into generative video and more martech startups will adopt AI to flesh out their products. Sources in the industry indicate that martech startups are starting to look at acquisitions of early-stage AI startups to build marketing-specific features rather than implementing horizontal AI. Here too generative video will play a part. Adoption is key to breaking this vicious loop. Accels Swaroop added education and edtech startups will be impacted dramatically as video content generation becomes widespread. Then theres the digital entertainment space. The likes of Pocket FM Kuku FM Pratilipi and all could theoretically scale up content production by thousands with AI-generated audio. And they can add another layer of engagement if generative video also grows to a point where their stories can be automatically made into short videos the Accel partner added. AI-Generated Software Will Disrupt Everything Software will eat the world but theres also the fear that Software 2.0 will eat software itself. One of the early use cases for generative text has been in machine-coded software. We have seen examples of users recreating popular apps with generative code. No-code startups have sprouted around the world in this GenAI age. If Google and Microsoft are offering no-code ML tools businesses such as Akkio Levity Gyana and Indian startup Builder.AI are building dev tools around this to ease deployment of software and creating custom versions of software. But if legitimate software development has been eased by GenAI tools the same could be said for malware and rootkits which are just malicious forms of software. The rise of AI-powered hacks will also see cybersecurity teams deploy self-healing software which develops itself on the fly to thwart potential attackers. In this regard on-premise LLMs might be the preferred route for enterprises as they look to ward off attacks such as prompt injection. Prompt injection attacks aim to elicit unintended responses from LLM-based tools. Early versions of ChatGPT and others were vulnerable to certain prompts being entered by the user themselves but open source models are even more susceptible to manipulation of prompts by a middle-man or being fed malicious content to exploit the system. Accels Swaroop added that it could be as simple as changing the tone of responses given by a chatbot such as ChatGPT or Bard to more malicious forms of attacks such as revealing sensitive customer data (particularly scary for healthcare and financial systems). On the positive side AI-generated software has the potential to challenge established players such as Freshworks Salesforce or other SaaS giants where the data is more openly available. Investors believe that certain products with these SaaS suites might be more vulnerable to competition thanks to the rise of AI software in 2024. Enterprises Indian Startups To Hire For Generative AI We started this outlook story with a bit about enterprises and how adoption by this class of businesses will be key for Gen AI. Enterprise-focussed use cases are still in the nascent stage and enterprises themselves are still figuring out how to best utilise LLMs and other GenAI tools. One area where we expect to see a lot more activity is hiring of AI talent and particularly in leadership roles. Enterprise hiring will be the big signal here. We are already seeing leadership hiring and positions like chief AI officer (CAIO). Budget allocation for people is going to rise in 2024 but companies will be hiring for AI-specific roles because they realise that its not possible to run this as a side project. AI needs focussed effort added Doraswamy. A chief AI officer would not only be responsible for setting a companys overall AI strategy including the design development and implementation but would also have to work closely with policy heads in government departments to ensure compatibility with future legislation on AI. It is a much broader role than just someone who knows the ins-and-outs of AI and the engineering side of things. Even though Infosys and other IT giants in India have major plans in the GenAI world the trend of the CAIO has not yet crossed over to India. It is very likely 2024 will see the first major appointment in this regard breaking the dam. But even on the engineering side a lot of competition is expected for the right AI talent.',\n",
       " 'headline: iOS 18: Apple gears up to unveil Generative AI into iPhones at WWDC 2024 says Mark Gurman  Mint.  content:  In a tech race against its competitors Apple is reportedly gearing up to unveil groundbreaking generative AI-based tools for its coveted iPhone series at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024 scheduled for June. According to insights from Bloombergs tech guru Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter (via mysmartprice) Apples forthcoming iOS 18 update will usher in a new era of artificial intelligence introducing a host of innovative features designed to enhance user experiences. The anticipated AI features could include auto-summarization allowing users to distill lengthy content and an auto-complete function for apps streamlining interactions with applications. Furthermore Apple is said to integrate AI into Apple Music promising a more personalized and intuitive music streaming experience. The report also hints at the introduction of new AI-based developer tools providing creators with enhanced capabilities to innovate within the Apple ecosystem. Gurman reveals that Apple has been diligently developing a proprietary Large Language Model (LLM) named Ajax since early 2023. This advanced model aims to infuse AI capabilities into Apples flagship products such as Macs and iPhones. The LLM will play a pivotal role in integrating AI into services like Siri Apple Music core apps and more. However Apple is expected to adopt a cautious approach opting for a gradual rollout of these features. The tech giants visionary roadmap extends beyond 2024 with Gurman projecting a full-scale realization of Apples AI vision by 2025. This ambitious timeline suggests that not all AI-centric announcements may materialize in the upcoming year underlining Apples commitment to methodical and meticulous integration of new technologies. Beyond AI developments Gurman provides a glimpse into Apples broader product strategy. In February consumers can anticipate the launch of the Apple Vision Pro a much-anticipated mixed reality headset. March is reportedly set to witness the introduction of refreshed iPad Pros boasting OLED displays and the powerful M3 SoC alongside the possible debut of a larger 12.9-inch iPad Air. Additionally an upgraded Apple TV 4K equipped with a new chipset might grace the market in the first half of 2024 according to Gurman.

       " 'headline: How bots are transforming Indias call-centre industry  Mint.  content:  India Incs dependence on call centres is changing rapidly as the first level of calls are increasingly being handled by bots. This means companies are now looking for employees who can speak several languages understand complex financial processes upsell products and work across platforms. Arjun Ramaraju chief executive of Conneqt Business Solutions said The IT BFSI and retail sectors have some of our top clients in India. The bots help with first-stage transaction-level communication with customers and are taken over by people when the processes become more complex. The digital IT and business process management services provider employs 30000 call-centre agents. Three years ago it had 20000 agents. Interestingly the push to recruit more agents is coming in from non-metros. Tier 2 and 3 towns are the prominent drivers of the growth of call centres as people from these places still want to interact with customer service in regional languages Ramaraju added. Business process management company WNS noted that call centre agents now need domain knowledge to handle complex questions from customers. Query management has changed and resolutions are no longer binary. Business-to-consumer (B2C) startups now use both bots and agents to handle their customers said R. Swaminathan chief people officer at WNS. The company said that while revenues are growing at 12% a year hiring has risen by 5-6% annually. Swaminathan pointed out that while BFSI clients are prominent those in smaller towns need to talk to agents for equities-related queries that bots cant handle. The tug-of-war between bots and human employees at call centres is due to digitisation across profiles as companies look to become more cost-efficient. For instance HDFC has compiled reasons why a customer would want to reach out and allows them to perform more than 200 types of transactions over WhatsApp. It has about 10 million customers registered on WhatsApp banking. Customers now tweet send a text message WhatsApp or call phonebanking staff. We have now unified these customer-care channels and through WhatsApp banking one could have a more meaningful conversation than before Anjani Rathor chief digital officer of the bank said in an earlier interview with Mint . The number jobs at the lower end is growing quickly while senior roles are petering out. This could affect career transitions. Automation technologies are reshaping the BPO industry impacting contact centers and call centers globally. Robotic process automation (RPA) natural language processing (NLP)-powered chatbots machine learning (ML) intelligent data processing (IDP) and cognitive virtual assistants (CVA) are some of the automation tools disrupting the outsourcing world said Ritu Sethi partner technology practice at recruitment firm ABC Consultants. Mint reported last week that a wider deployment of AI technology by India Inc would likely make 15000-20000 jobs redundant this year as a large number of coding profiles system maintenance and support functions at junior levels will become automated. Amid widespread fears that automation will wipe away repetitive roles in the BPO industry it has been observed that technology has in fact helped increase productivity and efficiency thus augmenting the performance of employees Sethi added.

       " 'headline: AI can transform education for the better.  content: A S PUPILS AND students return to classrooms and lecture halls for the new year it is striking to reflect on how little education has changed in recent decades. Laptops and interactive whiteboards hardly constitute disruption. Many parents bewildered by how their children shop or socialise would be unruffled by how they are taught. The sector remains a digital laggard: American schools and universities spend around 2% and 5% of their budgets respectively on technology compared with 8% for the average American company. Techies have long coveted a bigger share of the $6trn the world spends each year on education. When the pandemic forced schools and universities to shut down the moment for a digital offensive seemed nigh. Students flocked to online learning platforms to plug gaps left by stilted Zoom classes. The market value of Chegg a provider of online tutoring jumped from $5bn at the start of 2020 to $12bn a year later. Byjus an Indian peer soared to a private valuation of $22bn in March 2022 as it snapped up other providers across the world. Global venture-capital investment in education-related startups jumped from $7bn in 2019 to $20bn in 2021 according to Crunchbase a data provider. Then once covid was brought to heel classes resumed much as before. By the end of 2022 Cheggs market value had slumped back to $3bn. Early last year investment firms including BlackRock and Prosus started marking down the value of their stakes in Byjus as its losses mounted. In hindsight we grew a bit too big a bit too fast admits Divya Gokulnath the companys co-founder. If the pandemic couldnt overcome the education sectors resistance to digital disruption can artificial intelligence Chat GPT -like generative AI which can converse cleverly on a wide variety of subjects certainly looks the part. So much so that educationalists began to panic that students would use it to cheat on essays and homework. In January 2023 New York City banned Chat GPT from public schools. Increasingly however it is generating excitement as a means to provide personalised tutoring to students and speed up tedious tasks such as marking. By May New York had let the bot back into classrooms. Learners for their part are embracing the technology. Two-fifths of undergraduates surveyed last year by Chegg reported using an AI chatbot to help them with their studies with half of those using it daily. Indeed the technologys popularity has raised awkward questions for companies like Chegg whose share price plunged last May after Dan Rosensweig its chief executive told investors it was losing customers to Chat GPT . Yet there are good reasons to believe that education specialists who harness AI will eventually prevail over generalists such as Open AI  the maker of Chat GPT  and other tech firms eyeing the education business. For one AI chatbots have a bad habit of spouting nonsense an unhelpful trait in an educational context. Students want content from trusted providers argues Kate Edwards chief pedagogist at Pearson a textbook publisher. The company has not allowed Chat GPT and other AI s to ingest its material but has instead used the content to train its own models which it is embedding into its suite of learning apps. Rivals including McGraw Hill are taking a similar approach. Chegg has likewise developed its own AI bot that it has trained on its ample dataset of questions and answers. What is more as Cheggs Mr Rosensweig argues teaching is not merely about giving students an answer but about presenting it in a way that helps them learn. Understanding pedagogy thus gives education specialists an edge. Pearson has designed its AI tools to engage students by breaking complex topics down testing their understanding and providing quick feedback says Ms Edwards. Byjus is incorporating forgetting curves for students into the design of its AI tutoring tools refreshing their memories at personalised intervals. Chatbots must also be tailored to different age groups to avoid either bamboozling or infantilising students. Specialists that have already forged relationships with risk-averse educational institutions will have the added advantage of being able to embed AI into otherwise familiar products. Anthology a maker of education software has incorporated generative- AI features into its Blackboard Learn program to help teachers speedily create course outlines rubrics and tests. Established suppliers are also better placed to instruct teachers on how to make use of AI s capabilities. AI for effort Bringing AI to education will not be easy. Although teachers have endured a covid-induced crash course in education technology many are still behind the learning curve. Less than a fifth of British educators surveyed by Pearson last year reported receiving training on digital learning tools. Tight budgets at many institutions will make selling new technology an uphill battle. AI sceptics will have to be won over and new AI -powered tools may be needed to catch AI -powered cheating. Thorny questions will inevitably arise as to what all this means for the jobs of teachers: their attention may need to shift towards motivating students and instructing them on how to best work with AI tools. We owe the industry answers on how to harness this technology declares Bruce Dahlgren boss of Anthology. If those answers can be provided it is not just companies like Mr Dahlgrens that stand to benefit. An influential paper from 1984 by Benjamin Bloom an educational psychologist found that one-to-one tutoring both improved the average academic performance of students and reduced the variance between them. AI could at last make individual tutors viable for the many. With the learning of students especially those from poorer households set back by the upheaval of the pandemic such a development would certainly deserve top marks.

       " 'headline: A New Way to Tell Deepfakes From Real Photos: Can It Work  Mint.  content:  Earlier this year an image of the Pope in a chic white puffer coat went viral in a striking example of how an AI-generated image can fool the internet. With a flood of this content predicted well need new ways to tell whats real and whats not. Can we build an AI deepfake detector was the initial idea when work started four years ago on one such effort to create a standard for online images says Dana Rao general counsel and chief trust officer at Adobe maker of Photoshop. Adobe is one of the companies spearheading the Content Authenticity Initiative a global coalition of 2000 members from tech policy and media (including The Wall Street Journal). The groups strategy has changed as work has progressed he says. Here he talks with the Journals The Future of Everything podcast about using data to underpin trust on the internet. Adobe was thinking about creating something to detect if an image was made by AI. But now youre going a different way Right it was sort of the obvious solution which is I just want someone to tell me if this is fake or not. The problem is you need to be very very very accurate on that deepfake detection because if youre wrong a lot no ones going to trust it. So it has to be like 99% accurate. And what we saw was more like 60% accurate. So we felt detection is not the answer. We flipped the problem on the head and thats when we started the Content Authenticity Initiative. We said Instead of trying to catch the lies how do we help people prove whats true Thats important [because] once youre in a world where youre being deceived by deepfakes the next time you see something youre going to say I dont know if its true or not. Were going to get desensitized to audio and video information because we have no way to know. So you wanted to start from the other end. How does that work Weve created this technology called content credentials. Its like a nutrition label for an image or video or audio. It will tell you who made the image when it was made where it was made and what edits were made along the way. If youre in Photoshop for example you click on content credentials because you want to capture this informationbecause you want people to believe youand then you can edit. If you change the lighting or you remove a blemish all that gets captured. Then when you export it that metadata goes with it. The viewer will see a little symbol on the image that says CR. You click on it and you can look at [the metadata] for yourself. You still have to decide whether you trust that right For an average user how helpful will those content credentials be First you dont need to believe everything right If youre on Facebook and you took a picture of a cat with a hat on it you dont need to prove that is true or not. But people will expect on important events that [those posting the images] will have taken the time to prove it. So Ill see that symbol Ill be able to click on it and be able to decide for myself whether or not to believe it or not. Its a chain of trust built from from the very first place the image is captured to where it gets published. Are there risks for content creators Say youre in a place where theres a dictatorship and youve taken this photograph of a damning piece of evidence and now your name is attached to it It is an option to turn on content credentials or not. You could say Im going to take this image of whatever the incident is Im just not going to sign it. Or Im not going to turn on my identity but Im going to capture other things like where it was taken when it was taken and the edits that were made. Its definitely up to the person whos choosing to use the content credential. They get to decide whether they want to reveal their identity or not. That was important to us as a design principle because we wanted to allow people to use this in places where there could be reprisal. When I see the image maybe I dont believe it as much because this person has decided to remain anonymous. But I have other information that I can use to trust it and thats a tradeoff right So the user who sees the image gets to decide whether to trust it. We want to empower the public to decide what to trust. Its always going to be you the user who decides whether or not you want to trust things. It makes me think that you need media literacy for this to work. When we talk to governments about the importance of combating deepfakes they ask us What can we do We say they have two roles: One is educate people that they cant always believe what they see. Its very natural for us to believe images. The human brain is trained to believe visual information. Second once we have content credentials out they need to educate the public: Theres a tool that you can use when you see something important. It should have a content credential with it. Whose responsibility is image authentication Is it the maker The user A publisher We are all responsible. If we dont all get on board with trying to make sure there are standards by which we can trust digital information were going to be in a lot of trouble in two three years maybe even by 2024 elections because were not going to believe anything we see or hear. These AI tools are doing amazing things. You type in cat in a convertible riding through the desert. An amazing image just shows up. You dont have to have any skills but now youre an artist right I encourage everyone to use these things. Theyre going to revolutionize how we all interact and create together. But they can be misused. And if you misuse them for the purpose of deceiving people you should be held liable for that. Companies are making AI image detectors. What do you say to them Its great to continue to research this area. The problem with a lot of deepfake detection is that it happens after the fact. So by the time you attach a label to a lie millions of people have already seen it and believed it incorrectly and then you come back and tell them its a deepfake. Its too late. You cant unring that bell. What is it going to take to get these content credentials everywhere that internet users might see images I feel great about where we are in terms of we have an open standard. Theres a group of companies building this. We actually have a usable version of this in Photoshop. Its out there. You can use it. What we need to get it everywhere is for all the companies who have a role in this ecosystem to agree. A few have not. A lot of them are still kicking the tires on the technology trying to understand it. How do I build it into a smartphone Were not everywhere yet. Were hoping that everyones seeing the momentum since the spring with all the generative AI and chatGPT. Were seeing a lot more people come into the fold saying Oh we now see the problem. What does our consumption of images look like in 10 years Itll all be digital and were going to see more content than ever. Everyones got a story to tell and were going to see a lot of those stories out there. The importance of having authenticity is going to be just as important. Interview has been edited and condensed.

       " 'headline: Microsoft launches consumer version of Copilot AI assistant. Details here  Mint.  content:  In this era of artificial intelligence Microsoft is opening up its AI assistant to customers and making the corporate version available to smaller companies to increase the number of paying customers for thenew services Bloomberg reported. The company is selling a $20-a-month consumer version of Copilot with access to OpenAIs latest ChatGPT technology and image-creation features said Redmond in an official statement. Consumers with a cloud subscription toOffice will be able to use Copilot to help answer questions summarize data and create content in Word Outlook Excel and PowerPoint. The Washington-based software giant will get rid of the 300-subscription minimum for its enterprise service it said as quoted by Bloomberg. Office products are still one of the best ways for Microsoft to charge extra for artificial intelligence support even after the company redesigned almost all of its products around OpenAI-based artificial intelligence tools. Executives have said demand is unusually high with Azure chief Scott Guthrie likening it to the lines outside shops to purchase Windows 95 software nearly three decades ago. Jared Spataro a Microsoft vice president stated that Microsoft has been testing the Office-based copilot now called Copilot for Microsoft 365  since March. The company began selling it widely in November as long as companies purchased at least 300 subscriptions. We have just never seen demand in the commercial space for a product like we are seeing for Copilot from Microsoft 365. We have had pressure I have never seen from small and medium businesses saying why will you not let us buy this Let us try it he said. The company announced the new services ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos where Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella will speak in an interview with Bloomberg. Microsofts consumer service called Copilot Pro offers similar featuresto OpenAIs ChatGPT Plus at the same price though the integration with Office differentiates their product Spataro said. The companyplans to roll out a builder tool similar to what OpenAI unveiledlast year to let individuals create their own Copilots for a specific topic a service already available to enterprises.

       " 'headline: Vodafone signs $1.5 billion Microsoft deal for AI cloud and IoT.  content: LONDON Jan 16 (Reuters) - Vodafone (VOD.L)  opens new tab has agreed a 10-year partnership with Microsoft (MSFT.O)  opens new tab to bring generative AI digital enterprise and cloud services to more than 300 million businesses and consumers across its European and African markets. The British company will invest $1.5 billion in customer-focused AI developed with Microsofts Azure OpenAI and Copilot technologies it said and will replace physical data centres with cheaper and scalable Azure cloud services. Microsoft will in turn become an equity investor in Vodafones managed IoT (Internet of Things) platform when it is spun out as a standalone business by April and help scale Vodafones mobile financial platform in Africa. Vodafones Chief Executive Margherita Della Valle who is under pressure to return the group to profit growth has identified an opportunity to help businesses digitise noting in May that the addressable market was worth 140 billion euros. She said the deal which she signed with Microsofts Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella would accelerate the digital transformation of our business customers particularly small and medium-sized companies. Vodafones Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said Microsofts leadership in AI underpinned by its OpenAI partnership would transform the telcos customer services. Thats the part that is really going to catch each and every one of our customers he said on Tuesday adding that a Microsoft AI-underpinned TOBi chatbot would provide more consistent and intelligent responses to queries. The technology would help Vodafones customer service staff improve productivity and the quality of their conversations the company said rather than replacing them with AI. Microsofts Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff said Vodafones strength in IoT and financial services were strategically important. The IoT assets are critical in helping us address the sustainability needs of so many of our customers in hard-to-abate sectors he said. Microsoft deploys digital twins to model manufacturing environments so that process improvements can be tested in the cloud. Vodafones IoT stack allows us to go into those environments model the environment create large-scale data stores and use AI to help customers meet their sustainability goals he said. Vodafones M-PESA mobile money platform which operates in Kenya Tanzania South Africa and other African countries shared the same objectives as Microsoft in the region such as building digital literacy. We are excited to bring generative AI capabilities to help customers make more intelligent financial decisions he said.

       " 'headline: Silicon Valley really really wants robots to get their ChatGPT moment.  content: At the start of the millennium most people thought of robots as a bit lame. Futuristic humanoid companions were fun to think about in movies starring Harrison Ford but less so in reality. A Guardian article from 2003 went as far as describing robots of the day as a motley crew of motorized bins. This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account Log in . Its a sentiment that might soon feel out of date if robot enthusiasts have their way. Following AIs breakout moment last year  driven by large language models (LLMs) powering chatbots  roboticists have been in desperate search of a breakthrough that will give them their ChatGPT moment. Ive been asked whats the biggest thing in 2024 other than LLMs. Its Robotics. Period Nvidias senior AI scientist Jim Fan wrote on X in December . We are 3 years away from the ChatGPT moment for physical AI agents. Fan noted that the robotics industry has been cursed for too long by the Moravecs paradox  the observation that stuff humans can easily do is much tougher for robots. Some recent breakthroughs suggest that curse may be lifting putting the robotics industry on a course that could edge it towards a ChatGPT-like breakthrough. The robots are coming Elon Musk got enthusiasts hyped up with the introduction of a next-gen version of Teslas Optimus robot in December. The robot appears to be capable of doing exercise  as well as other delicate tasks such as picking up an egg. Last week Google DeepMind introduced a bunch of innovations that might make the prospect of living alongside robots in your home safer and more appealing. The most important one was a feature called Auto RT. This harnesses the power of LLMs and other AI models like vision-language models (VLMs) to effectively give robots chore-busting powers for example. As DeepMind puts it  a robot working with this system could feasibly collect data on its environment through observation before generating a to-do list of tasks that it could carry out in response to say a messy kitchen. For each robot the system uses a VLM to understand its environment and the objects within sight the company wrote in a blog post. Next an LLM suggests a list of creative tasks that the robot could carry out.

Though prototypes are often shown off at the event this years robotics display has sought to highlight how AI can make robots useful. Nvidias vice-president of robotics Deepu Talla spoke at length during an address ahead of the event about how some of its partners  like Boston Dynamics and Collaborative Robotics  are using generative AI to help robots better understand text or voice commands. Samsung also showed off a new version of Ballie a robot it first unveiled at CES in 2020. A video shown of the yellow Roomba-sized AI robot shows its smart device controls in action at home as it switches on lights serves as a companion during workouts and even makes phone calls for you. AI alone wont make the path forward for robots straightforward however. Getting robots to function well has been a major challenge for some of the most well-resourced companies over the years. As my colleague Eugene Kim previously reported  Amazons home robot Astro has struggled to get traction. It has faced s cathing reviews and been dismissed internally by sceptics. That said Amazon is now turning to a new AI model to boost the robot and make it a smarter companion. Success could make it and others big moneymakers in the future  even if they arent right now. Research from financial firm Macquarie published in 2022 emphasized the importance of home-based demand for humanoid robots. If theyre any good and start being bought by consumers it could tilt the industry towards a $3 trillion market by 2050  the firms analysts think. If the future can deliver robots that are actually helpful the robots might not be so lame in the end.',\n",

       " 'headline: After passing another medical exam ChatGPT is moving one step closer to ChatMD.  content: ChatGPT is becoming a great medical test taker. Its latest and most advanced version ChatGPT-4 can already pass the US Medical Licensing Exam with flying colors. And now its moved one step closer to becoming a specialized physician. Well sort of. On Tuesday scientists announced that the newest chatbot software from OpenAI can handily pass a Canadian or US-style radiology board exam  scoring more than ten points above the 70% passing threshold. But theres a catch: Because ChatGPT is only designed to process language (so far) the AIs radiology exam didnt include any images. Feels like kind of a major oversight for a branch of medicine concerned with diagnosing based on X-rays MRIs and other body pictures. ChatGPT did well on challenging questions but got some of the basics of radiology wrong SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY/Getty Images ChatGPT has shown itself to be a formidable test taker  its passed exams including the SAT the bar exam and even the challenging master sommelier tests. On the radiology exam ChatGPT-4 delivered a passing score of 81%. The bot scored particularly well on higher-order thinking questions that require skills beyond just memory recall like analysis synthesis and evaluation ChatGPT-4 did well at describing imaging findings (85%) and applying concepts (90%). But it didnt do so great on some of the more straightforward questions on the test and actually got 12 of those questions wrong that its predecessor GPT 3.5 got right. We were initially surprised by ChatGPTs accurate and confident answers to some challenging radiology questions study author Dr. Rajesh Bhayana an abdominal radiologist at Toronto General Hospital said in a press release . But then equally surprised by some very illogical and inaccurate assertions. Why ChatGPT is increasingly good at acing hard tests At its core ChatGPT is simply designed to predict the best next word to spit out  in other words its built to chat you up. That chattiness can easily be harnessed to pontificate on exams producing a very confident (but sometimes wrong) test taker. Brown computer science professor Ellie Pavlick a natural language processing expert says this issue isnt unique to chatbots. Shes always struggled to tell whether students really grasp the concepts shes taught based on their written exam answers. If you give some well-constructed language it seems like you know but maybe you do maybe you dont Pavlick said during a recent ChatGPT roundtable at Brown University . This is a nice indication of why we kind of want to attribute much more knowledge and awareness to ChatGPT than it actually really has because theres just something about well-constructed language that can really mask [poor] understanding. Doctors say that ChatGPT shouldnt be used to diagnose or treat patients and should always have its medical accuracy checked by a person. But medical experts are also discovering how ChatGPT can be a nice tool for improving a doctors communication with their patients . It is precisely because ChatGPT excels at banter that it is often regarded as more compassionate than hurried doctors.',\n",

An investigation by the Stanford University Cyber Policy Center found that the LAION-5B database which has been used to train several AI image generators including Stable Diffusion 1.5  an earlier version of an AI model by Stability AI contained over 3200 images of suspected child abuse. Just over 1000 of those images were confirmed to be child sexual abuse material with the report warning that their presence in the dataset may allow generative AI tools built on this data to be used to create new child abuse content . LAION-5B is a massive public archive of around five billion images scraped from the open web. It has been used by a variety of AI companies which require huge amounts of data to train generative AI models that can produce new images in seconds. Experts have long warned that AI image generators risk unleashing a tsunami of ultra-realistic AI-generated images of child sexual abuse  with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warning that such images are already widely circulating on the dark web . Online safety organizations in the UK meanwhile have called for urgent action over instances of children using AI image generators at school to create indecent content of their fellow pupils. AI apps that use similar technology to undress women in photos by creating fake nude images of them are also surging in popularity according to data from Graphika . Stable Diffusion is the most well-known model to use the LAION database. The tool which was developed by UK-based firm Stability AI has become one of the most widespread and popular image generators since it launched in 2022. A spokesperson for German non-profit LAION behind the dataset told Bloomberg that the group was temporarily removing its datasets from the internet while it scrubbed them of illegal content. A Stability AI spokesperson meanwhile told Business Insider that the company has introduced filters to prevent users from creating illegal content with Stable Diffusion and that Stability AIs models were only trained on a filtered subset of LAION-5B. The company released Stable Diffusion 2.0 which was also trained on a subset of the LAION-5B data but has tighter controls on sexually explicit content  last year. However version 1.5 which does generate explicit content is still available on the open web. The spokesperson said Stable Diffusion 1.5 was released by AI video startup RunwayML not Stability AI. Runway told Bloomberg that it was a collaboration between the two however. LAION-400M a previous version of the 5B database which the Stanford researchers noted had been found to contain pornographic imagery racist slurs and harmful social stereotypes was used by Google to train an early version of its Imagen text-to-image generator. Google has since stopped using LAION datasets . BI reached out to LAION for further comment but didnt immediately hear back.

This isnt the first time Khosla has cautioned against overestimating the risks AI poses. Khosla told Eric Newcomer on a December 1 episode of the Cerebral Valley Podcast that he thinks people are too pessimistic about the technology. Too many people are looking at the dystopian angle of this one percent probability of something bad happening and ignoring the benefits to humanity of AI Khosla told Newcomer. Khoslas views set him apart from OpenAI cofounder Elon Musk. Musk who has since gone on to set up his own AI startup  is a strong critic of the potential dangers of AI. AI is more dangerous than say mismanaged aircraft design or production maintenance or bad car production Musk told Fox News in April. In the sense that it has the potential however small one may regard that probability but it is non-trivial it has the potential of civilization destruction he added.

       " 'headline: Why data is the new aluminum.  content: By Joseph Bartolotta When the discussion turns to analytics and data science do you immediately think of aluminum If you said no thats good  you shouldnt have. Until now. Aluminum has many applications. It comes in a wide range of sizes. It can be flexible or very rigid. It can be endlessly recycled and turned into any number of new objects when the original has served its purpose. When it was first discovered aluminum didnt have much practical value. Yet today its an essential part of our lives and its value has increased accordingly. Does this description sound familiar Replace aluminum with data in the previous paragraph and read it again. Theres an even more important parallel. In its natural state (a material called bauxite) aluminum looks like any other rock you might come across  and ignore. But without that rock you just kicked aside we wouldnt have airliners spacecrafts fuel-efficient automobiles or hundreds of other products essential to modern life. Whatever you call it  perfect camouflage hiding in plain sight or going incognito  the issue is that a great deal of value could easily be overlooked. And now for the startling revelation: The same holds true for the unstructured data in your organization. You deal with it all the time: Images video call recordings scanned documents chat logs PDFs and all those other types of files that arent in a neat row-and-column format. In fact 80% of all new data created every day is now of the unstructured variety. Yet it is frequently overlooked by data analysts and other data scientists because its not readily available in an easy-to-use format. Historically this kind of data hasnt been included in analytic data sets or data catalogs. Even those firms that sell data mesh and data fabric platforms that claim to make all of an organizations data visible and accessible inevitably exclude unstructured data. Instead they leave it at the source or buried at the bottom of a data lake  because they would rather not deal with it. If thats the case then why should anyone worry about their unstructured data Traditional structured data is very good for answering what questions: What were yesterdays sales What is our current customer satisfaction level What is the average output of Unit 3 But structured data tends to be backward-looking and it cant answer why questions: Why were yesterdays sales 10% over plan Why has customer satisfaction dropped by 5 percentage points this week Why is Unit 3 producing at half the level of the other units Unstructured data usually represents current real-time readings: news feeds call center audio files sensor outputs. In the examples above an examination of news feeds showed that a sudden blast of cold weather triggered a spike in coat purchases  driving up yesterdays sales. A sentiment analysis of customer service calls uncovered a recurring issue that continues to pull down satisfaction survey results. An analysis of the operating parameters of a specific production machine indicated that it needs maintenance which explains its lower output. All of these insights and answers are possible only by including unstructured data in models and analyses. While most organizations will say that theyre already capturing this kind of data  and even storing it in a data mart data warehouse data lake etc.  theyre not actually using it. Related stories Unstructured data is not routinely fed into AI models and its not part of most BI analytics mostly because doing so requires work. Unstructured data must be labeled annotated or transcribed before it can be ingested by any advanced technology platform. Unfortunately most organizations arent set up to do that kind of work: Theres no one whose job title is Data Labeler and theres no one with experience in recruiting and managing data labelers. So for those forward-thinking leaders aware of the value locked inside their unstructured data the solution is to find someone in the organization with data in their title. And thats how data labeling usually ends up being assigned to data engineers. Which is tragic. Not that theyre unfamiliar with the process or incapable of doing it. But its a very expensive way to get the job done  both on a direct cost basis and on an opportunity cost basis (if these highly qualified individuals are working on annotating data the jobs they were hired for are likely not getting done). Moreover these are resourceful people tasked with doing something theyd rather not do. So they find workarounds (e.g. purchasing someone elses already-labeled data). Or try to automate the process (using an AI-assisted labeling or transcription platform). Or worst of all shortcut the process (by using a generative AI tool to create synthetic data). But nothing is as powerful and unique as an organizations own experiential data accurately annotated and ready to provide a significant boost to the structured data already in an AI or BI tool. If labeling that data isnt something you can do a data services provider can do it for you (just be sure to find out where the work will actually be done and whether or not the firm has specific domain expertise for your business vertical). What does all this have to do with aluminum Actually quite a bit. Most people would pass by a chunk of bauxite without a second glance. It doesnt look anything like aluminum its nothing theyve ever used or needed before so its assumed to have very little value. But refine it into an ingot of pure aluminum and the possible uses quickly present themselves. All the scanned image files thousands of recorded customer service calls chat logs and enormous geospatial surveys are exactly the same kind of uninteresting ore  until those unstructured files are labeled or annotated. And then the use cases suddenly appear. Dont overlook your unstructured data. Recognize its true potential and refine it into valuable ingots. Youll outshine your competition.

Heres how to unlock its true business value.  content: By Kelly Ducourty Chief Customer Officer at UiPath AI has become ubiquitous driving companies to explore its applications for revenue growth enhanced customer experiences improved employee experiences and competitive advantage. In the workplace  the rise of Generative AI tools has ushered in new processes by which employees can more efficiently conduct research craft communications or summarize vast amounts of data. Although there is real enthusiasm for the technology most businesses are unprepared to leverage AI to its fullest extent. Recent research from McKinsey revealed that an estimated 45% of organizations have no AI at scale. As a result both return on investment and innovation that can be derived from AI are stifled limiting business potential. According to new research from UiPath and Bain  Company only a small number of companies are successfully applying AI to improve their business operations and create new value in their markets. For example the report found only slightly more than half of organizations (53%) have adopted some form of Generative AI into their operations. The research indicates that modern enterprises understand the potential of AI-powered automation with 70% of senior executives saying they view AI-driven automation as very important or critical to their business objectives and 74% expecting a positive return on investment from these projects. Specifically they believe AI-powered technologies will offer operational enhancements and facilitate new revenue streams by enabling new product or service offerings (58%) or options for data monetization (52%). AI-powered automation can help organizations boost productivity by eliminating manual tasks and improving the employee experience. By combining specialized AI  purpose-built solutions trained on a companys own data  and generative AI with the agility and speed of enterprise automation businesses can vastly improve processes eliminate errors and achieve faster results. Indeed organizations can expect productivity boosts of up to 20%. Two notable examples of successful AI-powered automation for increased productivity are Cathay Pacific and British Airways  which both offer AI and automation to every  business unit  from the back end to customer-facing roles  to empower their workforce. With AI-powered automation Cathay Pacific has given more than 200000 hours a year back to the organization and its employees and British Airways is expecting to save more than 300000 hours per year. Another example is Intel  a leading global semiconductor company that is using AI and automation to classify international shipments  a process that historically required many hours of manual processing. By applying AI-powered automation to this process Intel was able to classify more than 56000 products in just four months with over 99% accuracy. Why AI needs automation to deliver on its promise AI initiatives must be part of a larger business strategy in an organization and they must be governed trusted and actionable to be scalable and truly deliver value in the workplace. To make AI work organizations need automation. By merging context with action AI-powered automation sets a new bar for what businesses can accomplish. If AI is the brain automation is the body taking the insights from AI to create actual business value. Companies should first establish a structured value framework that identifies key value incentives such as increased efficiency or customer satisfaction. This helps align objectives with organizational goals ensuring AI-powered projects deliver on expectations. A value framework should: Define how AI supports business goals : Align AI projects with organizational goals by identifying key value incentives such as increased efficiency or customer satisfaction. Focus on cost efficiency : Conduct strategic resource planning and review end-to-end processes and streamlining activities to identify areas for resource adjustments. Prioritize governance in action : Demand governance from AI providers ensuring alignment with ethical guidelines and compliance protocols. This includes transparency in data usage lifecycle management security and integrity. Elevate the human element in scaling AI : Acknowledge the intrinsic value of the workforce by fostering a culture of innovation and continuous learning. Upskilling and reskilling initiatives are vital to prepare the workforce for AI integration. The next great technological revolution is here and with it comes new ways of working collaborating and creating. The good news is that every enterprise will be able to take advantage and achieve untold new potential. With higher workforce capacity and newfound agility businesses everywhere and of every size can execute whatever ideas and innovations they can imagine.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account Log in . That cost will be an issue industry leaders say could be the determining factor for the future commercial success of multi- or general-purpose robots. Single-purpose robots that can carry out a specific task such as the Roomba vacuum have become wildly successful. According to iRobot the makers of Roomba the company has sold more than 40 million units since its founding in 1990. So theres a desire for robots that can help with at least one of the workloads in the house. However industry leaders argue that part of Roombas success is its accessibility. Robot vacuums have long delivered the value for their price point hence their popularity Deepu Talla Nvidia s vice president and general manager for embedded and edge computing told TechCrunch in an interview published Saturday. On Amazon  a Roomba that can vacuum and self-charge can cost as little as $159. But a personal assistant robot that can carry out multiple tasks throughout the house Boston Dynamics CTO Aaron Saunders previously told TechCrunch that those robots might cost as much as a car and consumers must be convinced that the products services justify the cost. When would you pay as much for a robot as you would a car Saunders asked. When it achieves the same level of dependability and value you have come to take for granted in the amazing machines we use to transport us around the world.  Nvidias Talla similarly said that the trade-off thats been hindering home robots to date is the axis of how much someone is willing to pay for their robot and whether the robot delivers that value. The temi personal assistant robot  which operates almost like a Siri or Alexa on wheels and takes commands as it follows a user around can cost about $4000. Softbank Robotics NAO humanoid robot which is less than two feet tall and advertised as a programmable assistant costs about $13000. Industry leaders like Talla and Saunders envision general-purpose robots decades from now that will be much more complex can navigate less structured environments on the fly and can complete multiple tasks. There are a lot of other challenges the robotics field needs to solve including perfecting the humanoid form factor that Saunders said will be the obvious match to a world built around our form. A consumer-friendly price point will just be one of those challenges.

       " 'headline: The bosses of OpenAI and Microsoft talk to The Economist.  content: O ne reason the worlds corporate elite jet off to Davos each year is to check in on important relationships be it with critical suppliers or big-spending customers. This year many are wondering about their relationships with Microsoft and Open AI  the startup behind Chat GPT . The companies are the worlds most prominent purveyors of artificial intelligence ( AI ) which has the business world giddy. Open AI exclusively licenses its technology to Microsoft. The software giant is busy injecting it into products from Word to Windows. The relationship between the two companies is also under scrutiny. In November Sam Altman Open AI s boss was fired by his board only to be reinstated days later. Satya Nadella Microsofts chief whose company reportedly owns 49% of the startup supported Mr Altman during the ordeal. The kerfuffle still left many wondering about risks to what Mr Altman has called the best bromance in tech. When the pair sat down with The Economist in Davos on January 17th in their first joint public appearance since November they were upbeat and for the most part singing from the same hymn sheet. Their partnership is great and unbelievable. They often remarked on how much they agree. One concurrence was that 2024 will be a big year for AI . Microsofts huge bet on the technology this month helped it to dethrone Apple as the worlds biggest firm (see chart). Today it is closing in on a value of $3trn. Its forthcoming quarterly earnings will give the first clear indication of how much corporate customers are willing to spend on AI . Although some observers have been underwhelmed by the progress made by Open AI s latest model GPT -4 Mr Altman hints at new capabilities such as greater ability to understand and produce audio. Mr Nadella says models will get better at all tasks from writing essays to churning out computer code. I really think the magic of this is the generality says Mr Altman. The general-purpose nature of AI is one reason why Mr Altman thinks of the technology as a new computer. Mr Nadella sees it in similar terms. He argues that since the PC  we have not had sort of the real driver of getting more things done with less drudgery. Microsofts supply-chain team already use AI to help model the impact of their decisions without having to wait for the finance department to do this at the end of the quarter. AI s ability to replace skilled workers such as accountants raises concerns about its impact on jobs. An IMF paper published on January 14th calculates that the technology could reshape labour markets. Those with college educations are both most exposed to disruption but also best positioned to reap the rewards of a new wave of innovation. Both Messrs Nadella and Altman are convinced that the technology will create more new jobs than it destroys. Mr Nadella thinks it may make the labour market more dynamic by allowing people to learn new skills and switch jobs faster. That he says will cause some wages to go up and others to be commoditised (in other words decline). That disruption is likely to be all the more dramatic with the advent of artificial general intelligence ( agi ) which if it is achieved would be able to outperform humans on most intellectual tasks. AI doomers think this could generate all manner of ills from economic chaos to a robot apocalypse. Nonetheless producing AGI is the stated goal of Open AI . Mr Altman describes progress towards this aim as surprisingly continuous. He likens it to the evolution of the iPhone where no single new model represented a big leap but the technological advance from the first version to the latest one has been extraordinary. For that reason he expects the ado caused by the first AGI to be short-lived. The world will have a two-week freakout and then people will go on with their lives he says. Neither Mr Nadella nor Mr Altman will say when AGI might come around. Mr Nadella believes that by the time it does its use will be regulated: Nation states are absolutely going to have a say onwhat is ready for deployment or not. Mr Altman broadly agrees but is a bit more circumspect. Regulators he notes will have to weigh the risks and capabilities of AI as with aeroplanes which create enormous benefits despite occasionally crashing. Likewise AI s tremendous upside means that halting progress would be a mistake. Safety is not a binary question of using or not using a technology it is the many little decisions along the way. He points to the launch of GPT -4 which was pushed back by seven or eight months. Mr Altman ever the techno-optimist insists that technological prosperity is the most important ingredient to a much better future. Mr Nadella a corporate veteran strikes a more businesslike note. He talks about the 20 meetings he had earlier in the day with executives from a range of industries talking to them about something that they are doing where I can have some input. He is in other words firming up Microsofts relationshipsas befits a big boss in Davos.',\n",
       " 'headline: Google faces $1.67 bn damages demand at AI-related patent trial in Boston.  content: Alphabets Google went before a federal jury in Boston on Tuesday to argue against a computer scientists claims that it should pay his company $1.67 billion for infringing patents that allegedly cover the processors used to power artificial intelligence technology in Google products. A lawyer for Singular Computing founded by Massachusetts-based computer scientist Joseph Bates told jurors that Google copied Bates technology after repeatedly meeting with him to discuss his ideas to solve a problem central to developing AI. The lawyer Kerry Timbers said that after Bates shared his computer-processing innovations with Google from 2010 to 2014 the tech giant unbeknownst to him copied his patented technology rather than licensing it to develop its own AI-supporting chips. Bates innovations were built into Googles Tensor Processing Units used it to support AI features in Google Search Gmail Google Translate and other Google services Kerry said. Internal emails cited in the case show Googles now-chief scientist Jeff Dean wrote to others about how Bates ideas could be really well suited for what Google was developing. Another employee in an email said they were quite corrupted by Joes ideas. This case is about something we all learned a long time ago: respect for others dont take what doesnt belong to you and give credit where credit is due Timbers told jurors in his opening statement. A lawyer for Google Robert Van Nest countered that the Google employees who designed its chips never met Bates and designed them independently of the workers who did. He called Bates a a disappointed inventor who had failed repeatedly to convince a myriad of companies including Meta Platforms Microsoft Amazon.com Inc and ChatGPT-creator OpenAI to use his technology. Van Nest said Bates technology used approximate math that can generate incorrect calculations. Googles chips are fundamentally different fundamentally different than what is described in Singulars patents Van Nest told the jury. Ahead of trial Google had said Singular had requested up to $7 billion in monetary damages for infringing its two patents. At trial Timbers said Google should pay $1.67 billion. Google introduced its processing units in 2016 to power AI used for speech recognition content generation ad recommendation and other functions. Singular said that versions 2 and 3 of the units introduced in 2017 and 2018 violate its patent rights. A U.S. appeals court in Washington also heard arguments on Tuesday about whether to invalidate Singulars patents in a separate case that Google appealed from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.',\n",

To accomplish that the researchers used a transformer model a type of neural network designed to learn context and meaning in sequential data. The team at MBZUAI which calls itself the worlds first AI university has been granted a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office for the artificial intelligence system. The researchers have not yet released the feature but it represents a step forward in an area that has drawn interest from academics for years. There have been apps and even robots that can generate handwriting but recent advances in AI have accelerated character recognition techniques dramatically. As with other AI tools however its unclear if the benefits will outweigh the harms. The technology could help the injured to write without picking up a pen but it also risks opening the door to mass forgeries and misuse. The tool will need to be deployed thoughtfully two of the researchers said in an interview.Well have to create public awareness and develop tools to combat forgery said Hisham Cholakkal an assistant professor for computer vision at MBZUAI. Its like developing an anti-virus for a virus. Despite the concerns the inventors said they plan to apply their research to real-world applications within months  and theyre looking for commercial collaborators. From decoding doctors handwriting to crafting personalized advertising the potential of this development is huge said Rao Muhammad Anwer also an assistant professor of computer vision at MBZUAI. The technology could also be used to generate a large amount of synthetic data to improve how other AI models process handwriting. Story continues Theres still more to work to do however.

       " 'headline: Tennessee governor music leaders launch push to protect songwriters and other artists against AI.  content: NASHVILLE Tenn. (AP)  Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee on Wednesday unveiled new legislation designed to protect songwriters performers and other music industry professionals against the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. Lee made the announcement while standing in the middle of Nashvilles famed RCA Studio A a location where legends such as Dolly Parton Willie Nelson and Charley Pride have all recorded. Packed inside were top music industry leaders songwriters and lawmakers all eager to praise the states rich musical history while also sounding the alarm about the threats AI poses. Tennessee will be the first state in the country to protect artists voices with this legislation Lee said. And we hope it will be a blueprint for the country. The legislation comes as states across the country and federal lawmakers wrestle with the challenge of curbing the dangers of AI. The bill hasnt been formally introduced inside the Tennessee Legislature and the text of the proposal has yet to be publicly distributed. Lee said he wants to ensure that AI tools cannot replicate an artists voice without the artists consent. That involves turning to one of the states most iconic residents: Elvis Presley. The death of Presley in 1977 sparked a contentious and lengthy legal battle over the unauthorized use of his name and likeness as many argued that once a celebrity died their name and image entered into the public domain. However by 1984 the Tennessee Legislature passed the Personal Rights Protection Act which ensured that personality rights do not stop at death and can be passed down to others. It states that the individual rights  constitute property rights and are freely assignable and licensable and do not expire upon the death of the individual so protected. The move was largely seen as critical in protecting Presleys estate but has since been praised as protecting the names photographs and likenesses of all of Tennessees public figures in the decades since. Story continues It also was monumental in preserving name photographs and likeness as a property right rather than a right of publicity. To date only two other states  New York and California  have similar protections making it easier to seek damages in court. But no state currently has enacted protections against vocal likeness. And with AI posing a threat to almost every industry artists and other creatives are increasingly calling for stronger protections against new AI tools that produce imagery music video and text. If a machine is able to take something from someones lifetime and experience and re-create it without permission or take someones voice and use it without permission lets just call it what it is: Its wrong said four-time Grammy-nominated songwriter Jamie Moore. Ultimately the goal is to ensure that AI tools are not scraping and using an artists song or voice in order to learn how to spit out a song itself without the artists permission said Bart Herbison executive director of the Nashville Songwriters Association International. Another key aspect is fighting for proper payment. Herbison said he watched generative AI tools advance from writing awkward songs in February of last year to spitting out moving and emotional pieces by October. What it can do now is freaky scary. Its all people can talk about in the writers rooms he said. Other AI legislation is expected to pop up across the country as many statehouses resume work this month. Already in California a lawmaker has proposed a measure requiring the state to establish safety privacy and nondiscrimination standards around generative-AI tools and services. Those standards would eventually be used as qualifications in future state contracts. Another proposal has been introduced to create a state-run research center to further study the technology. On the federal level the U.S. Copyright Office is weighing whether to enact copyright reforms in response to generative AI. Meanwhile a bipartisan group of U.S. senators has introduced legislation called the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications Act of 2024. Supporters say the measure will combat AI deepfakes voice clones and other harmful digital human impersonations.',\n",
       " 'headline: Microsoft launches a Pro plan for Copilot.  content: Microsoft evidently envisions Copilot the umbrella brand for its portfolio of AI-powered content-generating technologies becoming a significant future revenue line-item. And thats perhaps not far off base according to the company more than 40% of the Fortune 100 participated in its Copilot early access program. But given the enormous cost of running GenAI models in the cloud getting Copilot from expenditure to reliable revenue generator will require sustained -- and large-scale ideally -- growth. Surely aware of this Microsoft is today launching a consumer-focused paid Copilot plan and loosening the eligibility requirements for enterprise-level Copilot offerings. The goal it appears is to broaden the base of potential paying Copilot customers while making Microsofts existing services -- namely Word Excel and the other apps within the tech giants Microsoft 365 family -- more attractive through AI features. Copilot Pro -- the new consumer plan priced at $20 per user per month -- gives customers access to Copilot GenAI features across Word Excel (in preview only in English for now) PowerPoint Outlook and OneNote on PC Mac and iPad -- if they have a Microsoft 365 Personal or Family plan that is. Copilot Pro doesnt come bundled with a Microsoft 365 subscription. As with the Copilot enterprise offering (Copilot for Microsoft 365) its a premium add-on -- bringing the total cost of the lowest-tier Microsoft 365 subscription to $27 per month ($6.99 per month for Microsoft 365 Personal plus $20 for Copilot Pro). The Microsoft 365 capabilities in tow with Copilot Pro are the same that enterprise customers have had for a while. In Word and OneNote Copilot writes edits summarizes and generates text. Copilot in Excel and PowerPoint turns natural language commands into designed presentations and data visualizations. And in Outlook Copilot helps draft email responses with toggles to adapt the length or tone. Story continues Beyond the Microsoft 365 upgrades Copilot Pro subscribers get 100 boosts per day in Designer (formerly Bing Image Creator) Microsofts AI-powered image creation tool to speed up the image generation process -- plus improved generation quality and landscape formatting options. And they have priority access to the newest GenAI models underpinning Copilot including OpenAIs GPT-4 Turbo  for what Microsoft claims is better performance during peak times. In the future Copilot Pro subscribers will be able to switch between models depending on their preferences and if they require even greater customization tap Microsofts forthcoming Copilot GPT Builder to create Copilots tailored for specific topics from sets of prompts. Copilot GPT Builder sounds suspiciously like OpenAIs recently released GPT Builder for creating custom chatbots powered by OpenAI GenAI models. But one presumes that Copilot GPT Builder will come with Microsoft service- and app-specific integrations. Copilot for business As Microsoft rolls out a premium Copilot for consumers its broadening the services business availability as well. Starting today Copilot is generally available for organizations subscribed to Microsoft 365 Business Premium Microsoft 365 Business Standard Microsoft 365 E3 and E5 or Office 365 E3 and Office E5. Previously Copilot for Microsoft 365 had a 300-user minimum purchase and required a Microsoft 365 license but both of those requirements have been done away with. There are a few differences to note between Copilot for Microsoft 365 and Copilot Pro the main one being Copilot in Teams. Enterprise Copilot customers -- not consumers -- get a Copilot in Teams that provides real-time summaries and action items handling tasks such as identifying people for follow-ups and creating meeting agendas. The different Copilot plans compared. Image Credits: Microsoft In addition Copilot for Microsoft 365 comes with what Microsoft describes as enterprise-grade data protection and the Semantic Index a back-end system that creates a map of the data and content in an organization to allow Copilot to deliver ostensibly more personal and relevant responses. Copilot for Microsoft 365 customers can also access expanded customization options via Copilot Studio a souped-up version of Copilot GPT Builder. Unveiled in November Copilot Studio lets users build their own chatbots and plug-ins and conduct fine-tuning with first-party company data. New free features Microsofts attention might be turning toward paid Copilot plans but the companys not completely neglecting free users. Today marks the launch of Copilot GPTs which like OpenAIs GPTs are tailored to topics of particular interest. A handful of Copilot GPTs rolled out this morning on the web client for Copilot fine-tuned to answer questions about things like fitness travel and cooking. A free mobile app for Copilot -- with access to GPT-4  DALL-E 3 for image creation and the ability to use images on a phone while chatting with Copilot as well as chat history syncing between mobile PC and the web -- is now live for Android and iOS. And Microsoft says that its adding Copilot to the Microsoft 365 mobile app for Android and iOS for users with a Microsoft account. Set to roll out over the coming month the Microsoft 365 mobile app Copilot integration will let users export content created with Copilot to a Word or PDF document. Lastly Microsoft says its expanding the number of languages Copilot supports. In the first half of 2024 Copilot will expand to Arabic Czech Danish Dutch Finnish Hebrew Hungarian Korean Norwegian Polish Portuguese Russian Swedish Thai Turkish and Ukrainian.

Writers Nicholas Basbanes and Nicholas Gage told the court in a proposed class action that the companies infringed their copyrights by including several of their books as part of the data used to train OpenAIs GPT large language model. Representatives for Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the complaint. The lawsuit follows several others filed by fiction and nonfiction writers ranging from comedian Sarah Silverman to Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin against tech companies over the alleged use of their work to train AI programs. The New York Times also sued OpenAI and Microsoft last week over the use of its journalists work to train AI applications. Basbanes and Gage are both former journalists.

       " 'headline: Sam Altman and Satya Nadella talk to The Economist.  content: O ne reason the worlds corporate elite jet off to Davos each year is to check in on important relationships be they with critical suppliers or big-spending customers. This year many are wondering about their relationships with Microsoft and Open AI  the startup behind Chat GPT . The companies are the worlds most prominent purveyors of artificial intelligence ( AI ) which has the business world giddy. Open AI exclusively licenses its technology to Microsoft. The software giant is busy injecting it into products from Word to Windows. The relationship between the two companies is also under scrutiny. In November Sam Altman Open AI s boss was fired by his board only to be reinstated days later. Satya Nadella Microsofts chief whose company reportedly owns 49% of the startup supported Mr Altman during the ordeal. The kerfuffle still left many wondering about risks to what Mr Altman has called the best bromance in tech. When the pair sat down with The Economist in Davos on January 17th in their first joint public appearance since November they were upbeat and for the most part singing from the same hymn sheet. Their partnership is great and unbelievable. They often remarked on how much they agree. One concurrence was that 2024 will be a big year for AI . Microsofts huge bet on the technology this month helped it to dethrone Apple as the worlds biggest firm (see chart). Today it is closing in on a value of $3trn. Its forthcoming quarterly earnings will give the first clear indication of how much corporate customers are willing to spend on AI . Although some observers have been underwhelmed by the progress made by Open AI s latest model GPT -4 Mr Altman hints at new capabilities such as greater ability to understand and produce audio. Mr Nadella says models will get better at all tasks from writing essays to churning out computer code. I really think the magic of this is the generality says Mr Altman. The general-purpose nature of AI is one reason why Mr Altman thinks of the technology as a new computer. Mr Nadella sees it in similar terms. He argues that since the PC  we have not had sort of the real driver of getting more things done with less drudgery. Microsofts supply-chain team already use AI to help model the impact of their decisions without having to wait for the finance department to do this at the end of the quarter. AI s ability to replace skilled workers such as accountants raises concerns about its impact on jobs. An IMF paper published on January 14th calculates that the technology could reshape labour markets.

The arrival of OpenAIs viral ChatGPT triggered a frenzy of venture investment and an abrupt change of course inside the worlds biggest technology companies since late 2022. This year several CEOs at the WEF meeting in Davos told Reuters that the latest generative AI still has a lot to prove. Cloud and internet security company Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince told Reuters that the months ahead may even feel like an AI letdown. Everyones like yeah I can build these cool demos but wheres the real value he said echoing a theme among business leaders attending the WEF meeting. ChatGPTs rapid rise is in some ways an outlier. In the first two months since its November 2022 launch the chatbot reached an estimated 100 million users making it one of the fastest growing applications in history. The program brought so-called generative AI to consumers fingertips letting people write a short prompt and generate a poem school essay or gather information as if with a search engine. It also proved a good collaborator for developing ideas in low stakes not business-critical use cases said Victor Riparbelli CEO of AI video generation startup Synthesia. But the enterprise is definitely not really ready for this chat-based AI he said in an interview. One problem Riparbelli cited is there is no clear path to end so-called hallucinations or false content generated by AI. While computer scientists have developed methods for constraining places from which chatbots can draw responses business leaders may not want the risk. Other concerns said IBMs Europe Middle East  Africa Chair Ana Paula Assis are stopping chatbot AI from reproducing human biases and regulation. Story continues Clients are still very worried about how they bring those solutions within the boundaries of regulations and compliance she said. Premier Li Qiang of China said in Davos that AI has to serve the common good but must be appropriately governed because it poses risks to security and to our ethics. And Chinas President Xi Jinping wants the United Nations to play a central role in AI discussions U.N. Secretary-General Antnio Guterres said Wednesday. Meanwhile some 90% of 1400 C-suite executives said they were waiting for generative AI to take a step beyond recent hype or were doing only limited experimentation and pilots survey results published by consultancy BCG showed. Big tech companies including Microsoft Alphabets Google and Amazon.com have pressed ahead courting thousands of businesses to give the latest AI a try. Some have marketed message-drafting meeting-summarizing AI as a way to save employees time. Google which has long used AI in its products is experimenting with a chatbot-like collaborator it calls Bard. And Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at a company event in Davos Wednesday that AI is poised to grow productivity and potentially accelerate science itself. Yet businesses revenue and profit from recent efforts remain unclear. GET REAL ABOUT AI While one Davos sign exhorted passers-by Lets get real about AI efforts to find a market for it have led developers to consider diverse places. Cohere a high-profile AI startup that is focused on enterprises views helping salespeople as one revenue path. Its going to be on the sales side and making sales teams more productive Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez told Reuters. The hope would be helping them do more outreach more follow-ups and automating a lot of that process. By contrast medicine is more complicated. While speeding up note-taking for doctors is a worthy task for AI automating the medical profession is not as this could risk lives said Gomez. We should be focused on assisting humans not replacing doctors and having a chatbot doctor Gomez said. Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan said the drugmaker was working with Microsoft with the aim of more widely rolling out AI to give samples to staff who submit 20 to 30000 regulatory responses a year. The next opportunity he said at Microsofts event would be AI for drug design. Tejpreet Chopra CEO of BLP Group a major wind and solar operator in India told Reuters he is ready to incorporate AI chat technology but only for internal use for writing good English not for content. Elections are a high-stakes area concerning AI companies as voters around the world head to the polls in 2024. Regarding the use of AI in misinformation campaigns Gomez said Coheres policies prohibit impersonation while Riparbelli said Synthesia does not allow customers to make political content through its AI video platform. OpenAI which also bans abusive impersonation through its technology on Monday said it is working with the National Association of Secretaries of State in the U.S. and will start directing users to CanIVote.org for election-related questions. Understanding how content is created is a key concern among companies and policymakers said Arati Prabhakar director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. If (people) see a video or an image they should be able to know whether it is AI-generated or human generated Prabhakar told Reuters in an interview.

This is not an easy feat. That being said new technology like ChatGPT is making the planning and ideation stage of creating a startup a bit easier. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot with vast knowledge that can aid in developing startup ideas. However it works best when provided with a specific prompt relevant to your goals. Before diving into detailed prompts having a general idea of the technology space or problem you want to tackle is ideal. If you are still exploring potential tech startup concepts in general you can begin by having ChatGPT generate a list of 10 varied technology startup ideas (or any number you specify). This gives you a starting point to choose a direction to refine further using more targeted prompts. Read on for examples of prompts you can enter into chat gpt to help generate your next tech startup idea. Problem-Solving ChatGPT Prompts For New Tech Startups Industry Specific Problems: What are the major pain points in industries like healthcare education finance or agriculture How can technology address these challenges more efficiently Emerging Technologies: How can emerging technologies like artificial intelligence blockchain augmented reality or the Internet of Things (IoT) be applied to create innovative solutions in various fields Consumer Needs: What are some unmet needs or inconveniences faced by consumers in their daily lives Can technology be used to simplify tasks improve experiences or save time for individuals Environmental Sustainability: How can technology be leveraged to promote sustainability and address environmental concerns such as reducing carbon footprint managing waste or conserving resources Social Impact: What startup ideas can have a positive social impact such as improving access to education healthcare or addressing social inequalities through technology-driven solutions Market Gaps: Are there underserved or overlooked markets that could benefit from tech solutions This could involve niche industries or demographics that lack specialized products or services. Collaborative Platforms: How can technology facilitate collaboration communication or connection among people businesses or communities Think about platforms that foster interaction and mutual benefit. Personalized Experiences: Can technology be used to provide highly personalized experiences in areas like entertainment shopping travel or fitness catering to individual preferences and needs Workplace Efficiency: How can technology optimize productivity streamline workflows or enhance remote work experiences for businesses and their employees Cultural Trends: What are the current cultural trends or shifts and how can technology adapt or capitalize on these trends to create innovative products or services Mixing and matching these prompts or combining different angles can often lead to fresh and promising startup ideas. After generating these ideas ChatGPT advises to Conduct thorough market research validate the idea and consider the feasibility and scalability of the proposed solution before diving in.

       " 'headline: The European bureaucrat who sends a chill through Big Tech just said shes looking closely at Microsofts relationship with OpenAI.  content: Microsofts investment in AI unicorn OpenAI is a success story for the legacy tech company. The Redmond Wash.-based giant once seen as a tech dinosaur plodding to catch up with the likes of Apple and Google  has seen its fortunes turn since investing billions in the buzzy AI startup. But now a reported investigation by the European Commission threatens to put that deal in danger. The EC said Tuesday it is examining whether Microsofts relationship with OpenAI which includes an investment reported to be between $10 billion and $13 billion would violate merger regulations aimed at protecting competition in the bloc. Britains top regulator known as the Competition and Markets Authority opened a similar inquiry into OpenAI and Microsofts relationship last month. The commission is closely monitoring AI partnerships to ensure they do not unduly distort market dynamics Margrethe Vestager the ECs executive vice president in charge of competition policy said in a statement. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment. Vestager is a vocal advocate of regulating Big Tech  a sector whose most influential companies continue to expand into new markets like AI while crowding out competitors in existing ones like cloud computing or digital advertising. The EC looked into a few of Apples practices including its iMessage system Apple Pay and the App Store over allegations the company unfairly excluded competitors garnering concessions in each probe. Vestager took a particularly hard stance on Alphabet with the EC instructing it to break up its online advertising business. (Alphabet said it will appeal the ECs recommendation.) Vestager and her team also fined Alphabet several times over the past few years for a total of 8.3 billion euros including imposing the commissions largest ever single fine of 4.1 billion euros in September 2022. The latest inquiry into a U.S. tech company indicates the EC is unlikely to pull back on its regulatory efforts. Lawmakers in the European Union seem to share that goal as well having proposed two major sets of legislation aimed at limiting the tech industry. Companies that either dont comply with the EUs new laws or otherwise fail to pass regulatory muster with the commission could face fines up to 6% of their revenue or even be kicked out of doing business in the 27-country bloc. Story continues Next week Vestager is expected to travel to the U.S. to meet with the CEOs of tech giants including Apples Tim Cook Alphabets Sundar Pichai and Nvidias Jensen Huang. A meeting with two OpenAI executives chief technology officer Mira Murati and chief strategy officer Jason Kwon is reportedly also on the books. The next powerful thing Ever since the worlds biggest tech companies released their generative AI tools to the public Vestager has been vocal about her desire to rein in developers and implement safeguards for the public. Last May she spearheaded a joint initiative between the U.S. and the European Union to develop a voluntary code of conduct for AI . Generative AI is a complete game-changer Vestager said at the time. Everyone knows this is the next powerful thing. Microsofts OpenAI investments come on the heels of another EC probe into the Windows maker. Last year the commission investigated Microsofts proposed $69 billion merger with video game company Activision Blizzard . American and British regulators also investigated the deal over concerns that Microsoft which makes the popular Xbox console and has a thriving cloud-computing sector that supports online gaming would wield too much influence if it also owned a video game developer. While the deal was ultimately approved the EC required Microsoft to grant rival companies access to Activisions games. Microsoft also faces an antitrust allegation from a rival tech company in Europe. German video conferencing company Alfaview filed a complaint with the EC last summer over Microsofts bundling of its video call platform Teams with Office. Prior to the ECs investigation announcement OpenAI reportedly began a pressure campaign to water down parts of the draft AI regulations European lawmakers were developing. The law  eventually adopted in June requires developers of general purpose AI like ChatGPT to abide by certain transparency and safety requirements. Microsoft in addition to being OpenAIs biggest investor has always had a close relationship with the startup. Those ties received close attention during the brief ouster and subsequent return of OpenAI CEO and cofounder Sam Altman. Microsoft was blindsided by Altmans firing reportedly learning about it only a minute before it was announced publicly and the episode raised questions about OpenAIs obligations to its largest investor as well as its opaque and unusual corporate structure . OpenAI is structured as a nonprofit with a for-profit subsidiary that develops ChatGPT and AI image generator DALL-E and which Microsoft has invested in. The ensuing turmoil strengthened Microsofts position as it successfully pushed for the return of Altman its preferred CEO and secured a nonvoting board seat. When reached for comment about the ECs announcement and its relationship with OpenAI Microsoft replied: Since 2019 weve forged a partnership with OpenAI that has fostered more AI innovation and competition while preserving independence for both companies a Microsoft spokesperson told Fortune . The only thing that has changed recently is that Microsoft will now have a nonvoting observer on OpenAIs board. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com',\n",

       " 'headline: This week in AI: AI ethics keeps falling by the wayside.  content: Keeping up with an industry as fast-moving as AI is a tall order. So until an AI can do it for you heres a handy roundup of recent stories in the world of machine learning along with notable research and experiments we didnt cover on their own. This week in AI the news cycle finally (finally) quieted down a bit ahead of the holiday season. But thats not to suggest there was a dearth to write about a blessing and a curse for this sleep-deprived reporter. A particular headline from the AP caught my eye this morning: AI image-generators are being trained on explicit photos of children. The gist of the story is LAION a dataset used to train many popular open source and commercial AI image generators including Stable Diffusion and Imagen  contains thousands of images of suspected child sexual abuse. A watchdog group based at Stanford the Stanford Internet Observatory worked with anti-abuse charities to identify the illegal material and report the links to law enforcement. Now LAION a nonprofit has taken down its training data and pledged to remove the offending materials before republishing it. But the incident serves to underline just how little thought is being put into generative AI products as the competitive pressures ramp up. Thanks to the proliferation of no-code AI model creation tools its becoming frightfully easy to train generative AI on any dataset imaginable. Thats a boon for startups and tech giants alike to get such models out the door. With the lower barrier to entry however comes the temptation to cast aside ethics in favor of an accelerated path to market. Ethics is hard -- theres no denying that. Combing through the thousands of problematic images in LAION to take this weeks example wont happen overnight. And ideally developing AI ethically involves working with all relevant stakeholders including organizations that represent groups often marginalized and adversely impacted by AI systems. Story continues The industry is full of examples of AI release decisions made with shareholders not ethicists in mind. Take for instance Bing Chat (now Microsoft Copilot) Microsofts AI-powered chatbot on Bing which at launch compared a journalist to Hitler and insulted their appearance. As of October ChatGPT and Bard Googles ChatGPT competitor were still giving outdated racist medical advice. And the latest version of OpenAIs image generator DALL-E shows evidence of Anglocentrism. Suffice it to say harms are being done in the pursuit of AI superiority -- or at least Wall Streets notion of AI superiority. Perhaps with the passage of the EUs AI regulations which threaten fines for noncompliance with certain AI guardrails theres some hope on the horizon. But the road ahead is long indeed. Here are some other AI stories of note from the past few days: Predictions for AI in 2024: Devin lays out his predictions for AI in 2024 touching on how AI might impact the U.S. primary elections and whats next for OpenAI among other topics. Against pseudanthropy : Devin also wrote suggesting that AI be prohibited from imitating human behavior. Against pseudanthropy Microsoft Copilot gets music creation: Copilot Microsofts AI-powered chatbot can now compose songs thanks to an integration with GenAI music app Suno. Facial recognition out at Rite Aid: Rite Aid has been banned from using facial recognition tech for five years after the Federal Trade Commission found that the U.S. drugstore giants reckless use of facial surveillance systems left customers humiliated and put their sensitive information at risk. EU offers compute resources: The EU is expanding its plan originally announced back in September and kicked off last month to support homegrown AI startups by providing them with access to processing power for model training on the blocs supercomputers. OpenAI gives board new powers: OpenAI is expanding its internal safety processes to fend off the threat of harmful AI. A new safety advisory group will sit above the technical teams and make recommendations to leadership and the board has been granted veto power. QA with UC Berkeleys Ken Goldberg: For his regular Actuator newsletter Brian sat down with Ken Goldberg a professor at UC Berkeley a startup founder and an accomplished roboticist to talk humanoid robots and broader trends in the robotics industry. CIOs take it slow with GenAI: Ron writes that while CIOs are under pressure to deliver the kind of experiences people are seeing when they play with ChatGPT online most are taking a deliberate cautious approach to adopting the tech for the enterprise. News publishers sue Google over AI: A class action lawsuit filed by several news publishers accuses Google of siphon[ing] off news content through anticompetitive means partly through AI tech like Googles Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard chatbot. OpenAI inks deal with Axel Springer: Speaking of publishers OpenAI inked a deal with Axel Springer the Berlin-based owner of publications including Business Insider and Politico to train its generative AI models on the publishers content and add recent Axel Springer-published articles to ChatGPT. Google brings Gemini to more places: Google integrated its Gemini models with more of its products and services including its Vertex AI managed AI dev platform and AI Studio the companys tool for authoring AI-based chatbots and other experiences along those lines. More machine learnings Certainly the wildest (and easiest to misinterpret) research of the last week or two has to be life2vec  a Danish study that uses countless data points in a persons life to predict what a person is like and when theyll die. Roughly Visualization of the life2vecs mapping of various relevant life concepts and events. Image Credits: Lehmann et al. The study isnt claiming oracular accuracy (say that three times fast by the way) but rather intends to show that if our lives are the sum of our experiences those paths can be extrapolated somewhat using current machine learning techniques. Between upbringing education work health hobbies and other metrics one may reasonably predict not just whether someone is say introverted or extroverted but how these factors may affect life expectancy. Were not quite at precrime levels here but you can bet insurance companies cant wait to license this work. Another big claim was made by CMU scientists who created a system called Coscientist an LLM-based assistant for researchers that can do a lot of lab drudgery autonomously. Its limited to certain domains of chemistry currently but just like scientists models like these will be specialists. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watchvOBklWt39Rcversion3rel1showsearch0showinfo1ivloadpolicy1fs1hlen-USautohide2wmodetransparentw640h360] Lead researcher Gabe Gomes told Nature : The moment I saw a non-organic intelligence be able to autonomously plan design and execute a chemical reaction that was invented by humans that was amazing. It was a holy crap moment. Basically it uses an LLM like GPT-4 fine tuned on chemistry documents to identify common reactions reagents and procedures and perform them. So you dont need to tell a lab tech to synthesize four batches of some catalyst  the AI can do it and you dont even need to hold its hand. Googles AI researchers have had a big week as well diving into a few interesting frontier domains. FunSearch may sound like Google for kids but it actually is short for function search which like Coscientist is able to make and help make mathematical discoveries. Interestingly to prevent hallucinations this (like others recently) use a matched pair of AI models a lot like the old GAN architecture. One theorizes the other evaluates. While FunSearch isnt going to make any ground-breaking new discoveries it can take whats out there and hone or reapply it in new places so a function that one domain uses but another is unaware of might be used to improve an industry standard algorithm. StyleDrop is a handy tool for people looking to replicate certain styles via generative imagery. The trouble (as the researchers see it) is that if you have a style in mind (say pastels) and describe it the model will have too many sub-styles of pastels to pull from so the results will be unpredictable. StyleDrop lets you provide an example of the style youre thinking of and the model will base its work on that  its basically super-efficient fine-tuning. Image Credits: Google The blog post and paper show that its pretty robust applying a style from any image whether its a photo painting cityscape or cat portrait to any other type of image even the alphabet (notoriously hard for some reason). Google is also moving along in the generative video game arena with VideoPoet which uses an LLM base (like everything else these days... what else are you going to use) to do a bunch of video tasks turning text or images to video extending or stylizing existing video and so on. The challenge here as every project makes clear is not simply making a series of images that relate to one another but making them coherent over longer periods (like more than a second) and with large movements and changes. Image Credits: Google VideoPoet moves the ball forward it seems though as you can see the results are still pretty weird. But thats how these things progress: First theyre inadequate then theyre weird then theyre uncanny. Presumably they leave uncanny at some point but no one has really gotten there yet. On the practical side of things Swiss researchers have been applying AI models to snow measurement. Normally one would rely on weather stations but these can be far between and we have all this lovely satellite data right Right. So the ETHZ team took public satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 constellation but as lead Konrad Schindler puts it Just looking at the white bits on the satellite images doesnt immediately tell us how deep the snow is. [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watchvKKLIlfvr7Vwversion3rel1showsearch0showinfo1ivloadpolicy1fs1hlen-USautohide2wmodetransparentw640h360] So they put in terrain data for the whole country from their Federal Office of Topography (like our USGS) and trained up the system to estimate not just based on white bits in imagery but also ground truth data and tendencies like melt patterns. The resulting tech is being commercialized by ExoLabs which Im about to contact to learn more. A word of caution from Stanford  though  as powerful as applications like the above are note that none of them involve much in the way of human bias. When it comes to health that suddenly becomes a big problem and health is where a ton of AI tools are being tested out. Stanford researchers showed that AI models propagate old medical racial tropes. GPT-4 doesnt know whether something is true or not so it can and does parrot old disproved claims about groups such as that black people have lower lung capacity. Nope Stay on your toes if youre working with any kind of AI model in health and medicine. Lastly heres a short story written by Bard with a shooting script and prompts rendered by VideoPoet.

After introducing a free AI Copilot for its Bing search engine last year Microsoft will offer what it calls Copilot Pro to individuals for $20 a month. The subscription will add a text-drafting number-crunching AI assistant to Microsofts widely used applications including Word and Excel and it will give purchasers access to new tools and AI models such as GPT-4 Turbo. The company also said it was removing a 300-person minimum requirement to buy the enterprise version of the software making the security controls and Microsoft Teams upgrade that come with the $30 per-month per-user Copilot available to smaller businesses. Microsoft now expects virtually all of its business customers to sign up Corporate Vice President Jared Spataro said in an interview. I cant imagine a commercial organisation out there that will not buy at least a seat of Copilot to see what its all about he said. Alphabets Google is competing with Microsoft in marketing AI for productivity and cloud software to business customers. Microsofts Copilot Pro is also entering an increasingly competitive consumer market.

Spataro said Copilot Pro would stand apart because it is integrated into applications that people use every day. (Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin Editing by Kirsten Donovan)',\n",
       " 'headline: Im a former FBI cyber agent. Here is my biggest 2024 election security concern.  content: While the 2024 election is several months away Congress has been prioritizing the security and sanctity of the vote. At the center of its concerns is generative AI and the potential impact it could have on misinformation fraud and other digital campaigns leading up to the election taking into account the power the technology has to create realistic-but-fake news stories soundbites and even videos of candidates. And while the presidential election is on everybodys mind state and local officials of even the smallest municipalities are now realizing that they are more likely than ever to be targeted by malicious cyber actors utilizing generative AI. Local leaders should be carefully monitoring social media in their region to dispel any possible misinformation campaigns before they spread. With the evolution of generative AI malicious actors can conjure up fake news articles and social media accounts quicker than ever easily sowing confusion or swaying public opinion before during or after an election. While gaining monetary value is always the top priority for threat actor groups its important to note that these malicious criminals are also targeting government entities to gain more notoriety and creating chaos can be a great way to do so. For example since the last election weve seen clear evidence that American voter machines were not tampered with but there is a lot of still lingering misinformation and confusion about this. The last few elections have shown us that misinformation is the most dangerous threat against election security. Foreign entities and nation-states looking to create discord would have a much easier time interfering in our elections by stoking this misinformation than actually hacking our voting machines. If foreign entities can use misinformation to discourage voters from going to the polls then they can make people doubt the election itself. These factors should motivate government institutions and their employees to exercise the utmost level of caution over the coming months. As we continue to face this increasing threat to election security this is the time to make the critical investments required to help protect our democracy.

       " 'headline: After huge investments companies need to make bank on generative AI.  content: If 2023 was the year companies poured money into generative AI 2024 is the year theyre hoping those investments start to pay off. From Microsoft ( MSFT ) and Google ( GOOG  GOOGL ) to Samsung and even Volkswagen and Mercedes businesses are quickly monetizing their generative AI offerings as interest in the technology among consumers and enterprise customers remains red hot. We expect 2024 to be a year of increased promotion and initial adoption and 2025-27 to be when the markets may take off from further applications to take advantage of the features as many key elements come together analysts with UBSs Global Research and Evidence Lab wrote in an investor note on Monday. On Wednesday Samsung debuted its line of Galaxy S24 smartphones complete with the companys Galaxy AI package of generative AI capabilities including live translation and photo editing features. On Monday Microsoft announced that it will begin selling subscriptions for a consumer version of its Copilot AI assistant for $20 per month per user. The tech giant also said it is opening up the enterprise version of its Copilot for Microsoft 365 to small and medium businesses. It previously only sold the service to businesses with more than 300 employees. Intel ( INTC ) Nvidia ( NVDA ) AMD ( AMD ) and Qualcomm ( QCOM ) are selling chips with their own neural processing units for AI apps PC makers are joining the fray by marketing their laptops and desktops as AI ready and at CES 2024 Volkswagen said its bringing ChatGPT to its in-car voice assistant by the middle of the year. Now companies just need buy-in from consumers. Is there a killer app Is there a demonstrable application or change that will then make people pay essentially more I think that is something [companies] will struggle with Gartner analyst Ranjit Atwal told Yahoo Finance. But thats not stopping businesses from taking a chance on what could be the next great technological leap. Time to put up If you followed the developments at CES 2024 earlier this month you know that seemingly every tech-adjacent company on earth is using AI as a means of marketing their products. Story continues Now its up to the companies that are making real AI products to deliver on the promise that the technology will truly change our lives for the better. The problem for companies Atwal says is that generative AI products offer consumers cumulative benefits rather than a single mind-blowing app thats easy to sell people on. Its a combination of elements that  will make the device easier to use. It will make you more productive. So everything becomes kind of cumulative he said. Cumulative is very very difficult to monetize. While selling the average consumer on generative AI products may prove tough enterprise customers are already on board. According to Microsoft VP and consumer chief marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi 77% of people in enterprises who have used the companys Copilot business software say they would never want to give it up. Microsofts Copilot for Microsoft 365 currently costs $30 per user per month the same price as Googles own enterprise offering Duet AI for Workspace Enterprise. Microsofts Copilot Pro will test consumers appetite for paid generative AI services. So will the so-called AI PC the PC industrys marketing designation for laptops and desktops outfitted with neural processing units designed to power AI applications. So far chipmakers like Intel say neural processors will benefit the average consumer by running generative AI apps on their personal devices rather than in the cloud helping to improve overall privacy and security. But beyond that they say well have to wait to see what kind of apps developers cook up before well know what AI PCs are truly capable of. According to UBSs Global Research and Evidence Lab though its just a matter of time before consumers get on board. We think the motivations use cases and technology enablers for [generative AI] on edge devices are aligning for initial highend adoption in 2024 and mainstream penetration from 2025-27 UBS analysts wrote in a research document. This has the potential to stimulate positive mix changes [spending on higher priced products] (driving requirements for more processing storage and upgraded peripherals) and could also pull in replacement cycles as new devices offer increased usefulness enabling content creation productivity and personalization.

       " 'headline: GenAI could make KYC effectively useless.  content: KYC or know your customer is a process intended to help financial institutions fintech startups and banks verify the identity of their customers. Not uncommonly KYC authentication involves ID images or cross-checked selfies used to confirm a person is who they say they are. Wise Revolut and cryptocurrency platforms Gemini and LiteBit are among those relying on ID images for security onboarding. But generative AI could sow doubt into these checks. Viral posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Reddit show how leveraging open source and off-the-shelf software an attacker could download a selfie of a person edit it with generative AI tools and use the manipulated ID image to pass a KYC test. Theres no evidence that GenAI tools have been used to fool a real KYC system -- yet. But the ease with which relatively convincing deepfaked ID images is cause for alarm. Fooling KYC In a typical KYC ID image authentication a customer uploads a picture of themselves holding an ID document -- a passport or drivers license for example -- that only they could possess. A person -- or an algorithm -- cross-references the image with documents and selfies on file to (hopefully) foil impersonation attempts. ID image authentication has never been foolproof. Fraudsters have been selling forged IDs and selfies for years. But GenAI opens up a range of new possibilities. Tutorials online show how Stable Diffusion a free open source image generator can be used to create synthetic renderings of a person against any desired backdrop (e.g. a living room). With a little trial and error an attacker can tweak the renderings to show the target appearing to hold an ID document. At that point the attacker can use any image editor to insert a real or fake document into the deepfaked persons hands. AI will rapidly accelerate broad use of private key cryptography and decentralized ID. Check out this Reddit verification post and ID made with Stable Diffusion. When we can no longer trust our eyes to ascertain whether content is genuine well rely on applied cryptography. pic.twitter.com/6IjybWRhRa  Justin Leroux (0xMidnight) January 5 2024 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Story continues Now yielding the best results with Stable Diffusion requires installing additional tools and extensions and procuring around a dozen images of the target. A Reddit user going by the username harsh whos published a workflow for creating deepfake ID selfies told TechCrunch that it takes around one to two days to make a convincing image. But the barrier to entry is certainly lower than it used to be. Creating ID images with realistic lighting shadows and environments used to require somewhat advanced knowledge of photo editing software. Thats not necessarily the case now. Feeding deepfaked KYC images to an app is even easier than creating them. Android apps running on a desktop emulator like BlueStacks can be tricked into accepting deepfaked images instead of a live camera feed while apps on the web can be foiled by software that lets users turn any image or video source into a virtual webcam. Growing threat Some apps and platforms implement liveness checks as additional security to verify identity. Typically they involve having a user take a short video of themselves turning their head blinking their eyes or demonstrating in some other way that theyre indeed a real person. But liveness checks can be bypassed using GenAI too. NEWS: Our latest research is out We found that 10 of the most popular biometric KYC providers are severely vulnerable to realtime deepfake attacks. And so may be your bank insurance or health providers Full report at https://t.co/vryGJ7na0i https://t.co/VVaSZrCZRn  Sensity (sensityai) May 18 2022 https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js Early last year Jimmy Su the chief security officer for cryptocurrency exchange Binance told Cointelegraph that deepfake tools today are sufficient to pass liveness checks even those that require users to perform actions like head turns in real time. The takeaway is that KYC which was already hit or miss could soon become effectively useless as a security measure. Su for one doesnt believe deepfaked images and video have reached the point where they can fool human reviewers. But it might only be a matter of time before that changes.

       " 'headline: ChatGPT-maker braces for fight with New York Times and authors on fair use of copyrighted works.  content: A barrage of high-profile lawsuits in a New York federal court will test the future of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products that wouldnt be so eloquent had they not ingested huge troves of copyrighted human works. But are AI chatbots  in this case widely commercialized products made by OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft  breaking copyright and fair competition laws Professional writers and media outlets will face a difficult fight to win that argument in court. I would like to be optimistic on behalf of the authors but Im not. I just think they have an uphill battle here said copyright attorney Ashima Aggarwal who used to work for academic publishing giant John Wiley  Sons. One lawsuit comes from The New York Times. Another from a group of well-known novelists such as John Grisham Jodi Picoult and George R.R. Martin. A third from bestselling nonfiction writers including an author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography on which the hit movie Oppenheimer was based . THE LAWSUITS Each of the lawsuits makes different allegations but they all center on the San Francisco-based company OpenAI building this product on the back of other peoples intellectual property said attorney Justin Nelson who is representing the nonfiction writers and whose law firm is also representing The Times. What OpenAI is saying is that they have a free ride to take anybody elses intellectual property really since the dawn of time as long as its been on the internet Nelson said. The Times sued in December arguing that ChatGPT and Microsofts Copilot are competing with the same outlets they are trained on and diverting web traffic away from the newspaper and other copyright holders who depend on advertising revenue generated from their sites to keep producing their journalism. It also provided evidence of the chatbots spitting out Times articles word-for-word. At other times the chatbots falsely attributed misinformation to the paper in a way it said damaged its reputation. Story continues One senior federal judge is so far presiding over all three cases as well as a fourth from two more nonfiction authors who filed another lawsuit last week. U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein has been at the Manhattan-based court since 1995 when he was nominated by then-President Bill Clinton. THE RESPONSE OpenAI and Microsoft havent yet filed formal counter-arguments on the New York cases but OpenAI made a public statement this week describing The Times lawsuit as without merit and saying that the chatbots ability to regurgitate some articles verbatim was a rare bug. Training AI models using publicly available internet materials is fair use as supported by long-standing and widely accepted precedents said a Monday blog post from the company. It went on to suggest that The Times either instructed the model to regurgitate or cherry-picked their examples from many attempts. OpenAI cited licensing agreements made last year with The Associated Press the German media company Axel Springer and other organizations as offering a glimpse into how the company is trying to support a healthy news ecosystem. OpenAI is paying an undisclosed fee to license APs archive of news stories. The New York Times was engaged in similar talks before deciding to sue. OpenAI said earlier this year that access to APs high-quality factual text archive would improve the capabilities of its AI systems. But its blog post this week downplayed the importance of news content for AI training arguing that large language models learn from an enormous aggregate of human knowledge and that any single data source  including The New York Times  is not significant for the models intended learning. WHOS GOING TO WIN Much of the AI industrys argument rests on the fair use doctrine of U.S. copyright law that allows for limited uses of copyrighted materials such as for teaching research or transforming the copyrighted work into something different. In response the legal team representing The Times wrote Tuesday that what OpenAI and Microsoft are doing is not fair use by any measure because theyre taking from the newspapers investment in its journalism to build substitutive products without permission or payment. So far courts have largely sided with tech companies in interpreting how copyright laws should treat AI systems. In a defeat for visual artists a federal judge in San Francisco last year dismissed much of the first big lawsuit against AI image-generators  though artists have since amended their complaint. Another California judge shot down part of comedian Sarah Silvermans arguments against Facebook parent Meta but her case was amended in December and joined with another one that includes writers Ta-Nehisi Coates and Michael Chabon. The most recent lawsuits have brought more detailed evidence of alleged harms but Aggarwal said when it comes to using copyrighted content to train AI systems that deliver a small portion of that to users the courts just dont seem inclined to find that to be copyright infringement. Tech companies cite as precedent Googles success in beating back legal challenges to its online book library. The U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected authors claim that Googles digitizing of millions of books and showing snippets of them to the public amounted to copyright infringement. But judges interpret fair use arguments on a case-by-case basis and it is actually very fact-dependent depending on economic impact and other factors said Cathy Wolfe an executive at the Dutch firm Wolters Kluwer who also sits on the board of the Copyright Clearance Center which helps negotiate print and digital media licenses in the U.S. Just because something is free on the internet on a website doesnt mean you can copy it and email it let alone use it to conduct commercial business Wolfe said. Whos going to win I dont know but Im certainly a proponent for protecting copyright for all of us. It drives innovation. BEYOND THE COURTS Some media outlets and other content creators are looking beyond the courts and calling for lawmakers or the U.S. Copyright Office to strengthen copyright protections for the AI era. A panel of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony Wednesday from media executives and advocates in a hearing dedicated to AIs effect on journalism. Roger Lynch chief executive of the Conde Nast magazine chain planned to tell senators that generative AI companies are using our stolen intellectual property to build tools of replacement. We believe that a legislative fix can be simple  clarifying that the use of copyrighted content in conjunction with commercial Gen AI is not fair use and requires a license says a copy of Lynchs prepared remarks.  This story was first published on January 9 2024. It was updated on January 10 2024 to make clear that a lawsuit brought by artists against AI image-generators and another lawsuit against Meta brought by authors including Sarah Silverman have been amended after judges dismissed parts of each case.',\n",
       " 'headline: Could SoundHound AI Become The Next Alphabet.  content: When we think of technological revolutions Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) invariably springs to mind. The tech conglomerate formerly known as Google influences the entire digital landscape starting from a distinct background of online search and advertising. In this dominant shadow a new player called SoundHound AI (NASDAQ: SOUN) is stepping into the light. Known for its expertise in voice-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) solutions SoundHound AI is following in Alphabets footsteps in many ways -- while blazing a unique trail of its own. Currently valued at a small-cap level of around $460 million SoundHound AI may not look like a contender for Alphabets massive throne. Yet the smaller company has a lot in common with the storied Google parent and may one day evolve into a similar cross-industry conglomerate. Let me show you how. How SoundHound reminds me of Google The story of SoundHound AI carries many echoes of Googles early days. The search engines early days as a school project by Stanford students Larry Page and Sergey Brin are the stuff of Silicon Valley legend. Seven years later SoundHound AI founder Keyvan Mohajer finished his Ph.D. in electrical engineering at the same school and started working on the Midomi song identification website. This project became the basis of SoundHound which took off in the smartphone era. So SoundHounds academic roots are pretty similar to Googles. But wait -- theres more Each company began with a disruptive idea. Google aimed to organize the worlds information while SoundHound AI set out to redefine voice-enabled AI technologies. Google and SoundHound AI always had plenty of competition but their advanced technologies often put them head and shoulders above the rest. The core of Googles operations is in analyzing and categorizing data to make it accessible through a user-friendly interface. Guess who else does the same thing but with audio data instead of mostly text Yep -- thats SoundHound AI. Story continues SoundHounds powerful client list SoundHound AI is currently building an impressive network of clients and partners. The customer list so far includes automotive giants such as Stellantis (NYSE: STLA)  Honda (NYSE: HMC)  and Hyundai (OTC: HYMT.F). Among its partners youll find restaurant chains like Krispy Kreme Donuts (NASDAQ: DNUT) and Jersey Mikes Subs food-service software expert Toast (NYSE: TOST)  and payments processing giant Block (NYSE: SQ) . Whether you noticed or not you may have used SoundHounds automated voice control tools at your favorite drive-through window or while telling your car what tunes to play or which temperature to set. Most small-caps would sell their proverbial mothers for a Rolodex like this one. Like Google before SoundHound faces several global markets with trillion-dollar annual revenues. Its early days in this companys efforts to make a commercial splash funded by an initial public offering (IPO) in 2022 and aiming for lofty long-term goals. SoundHound AIs quarterly investor presentations compare the companys market prospects to Google Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)  Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)  and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)  concluding that each of these giants offers value for a specific stakeholder group: Microsoft provides value for product creators. Apple adds business value for developers. Amazons economic value is best for merchants. Google is a valuable platform for advertisers. ... but SoundHound AI the company contends delivers unique business value for all four groups. From Stellantis and Honda to Block and Toast many solid businesses appear to agree. Ambition meets reality: Assessing SoundHound AIs lofty goals You might not take SoundHound AIs grand goals at face value. Its ambitious enough to claim similarities to one of the tech giants mentioned above let alone assert superiority over all four. That being said I appreciate managements moxie and see real value in SoundHoud AIs AI-driven voice control technology. Alphabet has been cracking the same nut for years starting with the now-defunct 1-800-GOOG-411 phone number lookup service. Data gathered from that voice-driven service served as a springboard for the companys future technologies such as voice searches at Google.com and voice input for Android phones. The 411 tool was shut down in 2010 and Big G never stopped developing better and smarter voice tools. Yet 14 years later SoundHounds eponymous song-identification tool and Houndify voice control platform can do things Googles voice systems cant. Its controls for infotainment systems in cars are often seen as great upgrades from the disappointing alternatives of yesteryear. This little company is going places. When you start from a tiny market cap of just $466 million it only takes a microscopic slice of the trillion-dollar markets to send the stock skyrocketing in the long run. SoundHound AI may never become a tech giant of Alphabets colossal stature but the company is growing in a hurry after many years of leaving money-making opportunities unexplored. I cant wait to see where SoundHound AI will go from here even if it never earns a trillion-dollar market cap and builds a Google-like Houndplex. Its the thought that counts.

       " 'headline: OpenAI changes policy to allow military applications.  content: In an unannounced update to its usage policy OpenAI has opened the door to military applications of its technologies. While the policy previously prohibited use of its products for the purposes of military and warfare that language has now disappeared and OpenAI did not deny that it was now open to military uses. The Intercept first noticed the change  which appears to have gone live on January 10. Unannounced changes to policy wording happen fairly frequently in tech as the products they govern the use of evolve and change and OpenAI is clearly no different. In fact the companys recent announcement that its user-customizable GPTs would be rolling out publicly alongside a vaguely articulated monetization policy likely necessitated some changes. But the change to the no-military policy can hardly be a consequence of this particular new product. Nor can it credibly be claimed that the exclusion of military and warfare is just clearer or more readable as a statement from OpenAI regarding the update does. Its a substantive consequential change of policy not a restatement of the same policy. You can read the current usage policy here  and the old one here . Here are screenshots with the relevant portions highlighted: Before the policy change. Image Credits: OpenAI After the policy change. Image Credits: OpenAI Obviously the whole thing has been rewritten though whether its more readable or not is more a matter of taste than anything. I happen to think a bulleted list of clearly disallowed practices is more readable than the more general guidelines theyve been replaced with. But the policy writers at OpenAI clearly think otherwise and if this gives more latitude for them to interpret favorably or disfavorably a practice hitherto outright disallowed that is simply a pleasant side effect. Dont harm others the company said in its statement is is broad yet easily grasped and relevant in numerous contexts. More flexible too. Story continues Though as OpenAI representative Niko Felix explained there is still a blanket prohibition on developing and using weapons -- you can see that it was originally and separately listed from military and warfare. After all the military does more than make weapons and weapons are made by others than the military. And it is precisely where those categories do not overlap that I would speculate OpenAI is examining new business opportunities. Not everything the Defense Department does is strictly warfare-related as any academic engineer or politician knows the military establishment is deeply involved in all kinds of basic research investment small business funds and infrastructure support. OpenAIs GPT platforms could be of great use to say army engineers looking to summarize decades of documentation of a regions water infrastructure. Its a genuine conundrum at many companies how to define and navigate their relationship with government and military money. Googles Project Maven famously took one step too far though few seemed to be as bothered by the multibillion-dollar JEDI cloud contract. It might be OK for an academic researcher on an Air Force Research lab grant to use GPT-4 but not a researcher inside the AFRL working on the same project. Where do you draw the line Even a strict no military policy has to stop after a few removes. That said the total removal of military and warfare from OpenAIs prohibited uses suggests that the company is at the very least open to serving military customers. I asked the company to confirm or deny that this was the case warning them that the language of the new policy made it clear that anything but a denial would be interpreted as a confirmation. As of this writing they have not responded. I will update this post if I hear back. Update : OpenAI offered the same statement given to The Intercept and did not dispute that it is open to military applications and customers.

My message this year is exactly the same only more so. The fog of unpredictability is again playing havoc with the clear skies of planning. We all know the term permacrisis. We have all heard of the acronym VUCA which stands for volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity. We all understand that the fourth industrial revolution is upon us. But my belief is that these three great forces have come together in an age of what I am christening permavucalution. It is my contention that three big permavucalutionary trends are at work. One is artificial intelligence. This technology will turbocharge the pace of change. Dont just take my word for it. The World Economic Forum thinks so too.

Lets Tinker. Lets EET. We need to get our arms around AI or we risk reaping a whirlwind of chickens coming home to roost. I know some of you are worried by what AI might mean for your own futures. I say to you: you cannot make an omelette without breaking some eggs. What if you dont like omelettes you reply Thats just ridiculous: who doesnt like omelettes Anyway I want to reassure you: AI is a way to make us all better at what we do. It is not likely to be the precursor to immediate large-scale lay-offs. Story continues The second permavucalutionary trend is climate change. At COP28 I had a chance to speak to some actual people who are living with the consequences of global warming. That experience was humbling and inspiring: it made me realise we have to do more in this area. As a company we are making every effort to reduce our own carbon footprint but action is never enough. We also need to be part of the conversation. Thats why Im so pleased today to announce the launch of our new whatdoyousee marketing campaign. When I look in the mirror I dont just see a highly successful executive someone who is driven to make the most of himself every day. I also see a father an ex-husband a brother a Peloton rider a vintage-car collector and a citizen of Earth. What do you see Please post your own reflectionspun very much intendedon social media. You can also send me an email (and see how I incorporate ChatGPT into my work). The third manifestation of the permavucalution is a shortage of talent. By talent Im not talking about employees in general. Im talking about the right type of employeespeople who are willing to take big bets who go the extra mile who see opportunity where others see nothing but extreme danger. Im talking about some of you. I have mentioned how uncertain and volatile everything is. That means we have to sprint to stand still. But thats not all. To respond to constant changes we also need the agility of a mountain goat. And to spot those changes coming we require the radar of a bat. Now just ask yourself this question: have you ever seen a sprinting goat-bat That tells you something about the scale of the challenge that we all face. I know that this level of uncertainty can be disorientating even frightening. But if we do not think outside the box and push the envelope we will never be able to capture lightning in a bottle. Finally my usual plea: be humble. I have coined a brand new term in this message but I am not doing so for fame or recognition as a deep thinker. I know I dont have all the answers. If I have a great idea I dont just plough ahead with it. I ask my direct reports whether they think it is a great idea first and only when they agree that it is do I act. Have the humility to follow my example and this company will not just survive the age of permavucalution. It will thrive. Heres to 2024 Stew Pidd CEO.  2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

       " 'headline: Navigating AI skills: How organizations hire the right people to leverage generative AI.  content: Generative artificial intelligence has emerged as a key technology to boost productivity for companies showing remarkable growth and immense future prospects. But its rapid expansion means leaders across industries now find themselves in dire need of experienced talent to develop and guide its evolution. As a result opportunities for generative AIfueled productivity are being put on hold because of the gap in skills required to execute on them. A recent survey from McKinsey  Co. reveals that talent shortages for the relevant skills dramatically constrain generative AI innovation. There are half as many qualified practitioners of the most sought-after skills than are needed to bring these capabilities into the mainstream. A few months ago companies were merely trying to uncover the realities of generative AI conducting small experiments to determine how their businesses could benefit from its implementation. But now one-third of companies are using AI in their operationsand half are increasing their AI investment mainly to deploy some form of generative AI in business functions such as marketing and sales product and service development and service operations. To remain competitive in this fast-changing environment forward-thinking leaders must prepare and develop new hiring strategiesor risk falling behind. Falling behind for a trend that promises to automate 30% of hours currently worked across the U.S. could very well translate into substantial losses in efficiency financial performance and overall relevance in the industry. Outsmarting skill scarcity The challenge is simple yet dauntinghow can leaders set generative AI in motion despite the skill scarcity that will continue to affect the jobs market for the foreseeable future The answer: hire from firms who have the AI talent ready to go. Ive seen numerous companies kick-start their generative AI efforts by making smaller investments via consultants or outside expertise that drive progress for the organization while the business continues its normal operations. Story continues Hiring experts from a firm that offers rapid access to a global pool of AI experts is a proven strategy for getting generative AI initiatives off the ground. This approach provides businesses with the specialized skills needed for each unique AI challenge allowing them to leverage generative AIs potential beyond geographical constraints and without the delays of conventional recruitment. Crafting a future-proof AI strategy Leaders should start by researching which skills are needed internally for the AI projects and focus their talent searches based on those requirements. The characteristics of a specific initiative will determine if the best option is a long-term engagement or a project-by-project approach. Leaders from organizations that have worked with Toptal a network of freelance software developers designers finance experts product managers and project managersemphasize the importance of experimentation in mastering AI. Theyve found that embracing a hands-on approach allows for swift integration keeping pace with AIs rapid development and bolstering company growth. Small-scale experiments such as automating routine reports and data sorting or integrating ChatGPT in creative tasks not only foster AI familiarity and competency within the company but also prepare the groundwork for tackling more complex challenges down the line. Experimentation should be strategic however concentrating on challenges that generative AI can effectively tackle. By pinpointing specific problems suited to generative AI solutions companies can streamline their focus enabling the creation of customized workshops centered on these areas. Ive observed firsthand how large organizations enhance their success by conducting AI workshops for their staff. These sessions are pivotal in showing employees the practical ways generative AI can streamline their tasks boosting efficiency across the board. Its this combination of experimentation and education that truly empowers a workforce to leverage AI to its fullest potential. Generative AI presents an unprecedented opportunity for growth innovation and efficiency. But its potential can only be fully realized when the right talent steers its course. As the demand for AI skills outstrips supply acquiring this talent is key. Those who can execute on their generative AI strategies successfully will win big in their respective markets.

       " 'headline: Whats next for Mozilla.  content: For the longest time Mozilla was synonymous with the Firefox browser but for the last few years Mozilla has started to look beyond Firefox  especially as its browsers importance continues to wane. Over the last few years Mozilla also started making startup investments  including into Mastodons client Mammoth for example and acquired Fakespot a website and browser extension that helps users identify fake reviews. The organization also launched Mozilla.ai to bring more of its open source ethos into the AI space. Its no surprise that AI is what the organization is focusing on right now. Indeed when Mozilla launched its annual report a few weeks ago it also used that moment to add a number of new members to its board -- the majority of which focus on AI. Late last month I sat down with Mozillas president and executive director Mark Surman to discuss whats next for Mozilla -- and what that means for the fans and Firefox. In the last year and a half weve been focused on making a pretty dramatic shift at Mozilla -- to make it about not just more than the browser but also more than our kind of activist personality and build out a kind of portfolio that sets us up -- and sets others up -- to go and take our values into the AI era or to the next era of the internet however you want to talk about it. Mozilla AI Mozilla launched Mozilla.ai just around the time GPT-4 launched and the first Llama models became widely available. Surman described this as a focusing moment for the organization.  Mozilla AI  which had a broad mandate around finding open source trustworthy AI opportunities and build a business around them. Quickly Moez [Draief]  who runs it made it about how do we leverage the growing snowball of open source large language models and find a way to both accelerate that snowball but also make sure it rolls in a direction that matches our goals and matches our wallet belt. Story continues While Mozilla did do some press around launching its AI efforts we havent actually seen a lot of movement in that area from the organization since. Surman told me that the leadership team had been planning these efforts for almost a year but as public interest in AI grew he pushed it out of the door. But then Draief pretty much moved it right back into stealth mode to focus on what to do next. At the high level where were positioning ourselves to be about making it easier to use any of the open source large language models in a trustworthy privacy-sensitive affordable way. Right now Surman argued it remains hard to for most developers -- and even more so for most consumers -- to run their own models even as more open source models seemingly launch every day. What Mozilla.ai is focused on really is almost building a wrapper that you can put around any open source large language model to fine-tune it to build data pipelines for it to make it highly performant. Mozilla buys Fakespot a startup that identifies fake reviews to bring shopping tools to Firefox What exactly this will look like remains to be seen but it sounds like well hear quite a bit more in the coming months. Meanwhile the open source and AI communities are still figuring out what exactly open source AI is going to look like. Surman believes that no matter the details of that though the overall principles of transparency and freedom to study the code modify it and redistribute it will remain key. Is it just the freedom to redistribute the finished model Is it the ability to study whats inside Is it to know what the weights are to see what the data was I think were still working on all of those questions. We probably lean towards that everything should be open source -- at least in a spiritual sense. The licenses arent perfect and we are going to do a bunch of work in the first half of next year with some of the other open source projects around clarifying some of those definitions and giving people some mental models. SAO PAULO BRAZIL - JANUARY 28: Executive director Mark Surman from Mozilla holding a Firefox OS phone. (Photo by Mauricio Santana/Getty Images) Surman believes that open source AI is a necessary component for making the next era of the internet open and accessible for all -- but by itself it is not sufficient. With a small group of very well-funded players currently dominating the AI market he believes that the various open source groups will need to band together to collectively create alternatives. He likened it to the early era of open source -- and especially the Linux movement -- which aimed to create an alternative to Microsoft. Then he noted when the smartphone arrived there were a few smaller projects that aimed to create alternatives including Mozilla (and at its core Android is obviously also open source even as Google and others have built walled gardens around the actual user experience). Those efforts werent really all that successful though. Surman seems to be optimistic about Mozillas positioning in this new era of AI though and its ability to both use it to further its mission and create a sustainable business model around it. All this that we are going to do is in the kind of service of our mission. And some of that I think will just have to be purely a public good he said. And you can pay for public goods in different kinds of way from our own resources from philanthropy from people pooling resources. [...] Its a kind of a business model but its not commercial per se. And then the stuff were building around communal AI hopefully has a real enterprise value if we can help people take advantage of open source large language models effectively and quickly in a way that is valuable to them and is cheaper than using open AI. Thats our hope. Whats next for Firefox Where does all of this leave the Firefox browser. Surman argued that the organization is very judicious about rolling AI into the browser -- but he also believes that AI will become part of everything Mozilla does. We want to implement AI in a way thats trustworthy and benefits people he said. Fakespot is one example of this but the overall vision is larger. I think thats what youll see from us over the course of the next year is how do you use the browser as the thing that represents you and how do you build AI into the browser thats basically on your side as you move through the internet He noted that an Edge-like chatbot in a sidebar could be one way of doing this but he seems to be thinking more in terms of an assistant that helps you summarize articles and maybe notify you proactively. I think youll see the browser evolve. In our case thats to be more protective of you and more helpful to you. I think its more that you use the predictive and synthesizing capabilities of those tools to make it easier and safer to move through the internet. In the early days of Firefox people moved away from other browsers because Firefox was significantly better at blocking annoying pop-up ads. Now Surman argues Mozilla needs to think about what the equivalent of pop-up blocking is for todays users. The question that were asking ourselves now is: Whats the pop-up blocker for the AI era Whats the thing that people are really going to want that stands for them and makes the experience of the internet better Mozilla looks to its next chapter Three years after its revamp Firefoxs Android browser adds 450 new extensions This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/03/whats-next-for-mozilla/',\n",
       " 'headline: What happened to the artificial-intelligence investment boom.  content: Many economists believe that generative artificial intelligence (AI) is about to transform the global economy. A paper published last year by Ege Erdil and Tamay Besiroglu of Epoch a research firm argues that explosive growth with GDP zooming upwards is plausible with ai capable of broadly substituting for human labour. Erik Brynjolfsson of Stanford University has said that he expects AI to power a productivity boom in the coming years. For such an economic transformation to take place companies need to spend big on new software communications factories and equipment enabling AI to slot into their production processes. An investment boom was necessary to allow previous technological breakthroughs such as the tractor or the personal computer to spread across the economy. From 1992 to 1999 American nonresidential investment jumped by 3% of GDP for instance driven in large part by extra spending on computer technologies. Yet so far there is little sign of an AI splurge. Across the world capital expenditure by businesses (or capex) is remarkably weak. After sluggish growth in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic capex increased as lockdowns lifted (see chart). In early 2022 it was rising at an annualised rate of about 8% a year. A mood of techno-optimism had gripped some businesses while others sought to firm up supply chains. Capex then slowed later the same year owing to the effects of geopolitical uncertainty and higher interest rates. On the eve of the release of OpenAIs GPT-4 in March 2023 global capex spending was growing at an annualised rate of about 3%. Today some companies are once again ramping up capex to seize what they see as the enormous opportunity in AI. This year forecasters reckon that Microsofts spending (including on research and development) will probably rise by close to 20%. Nvidias is set to soar by upwards of 30%. AI will be our biggest investment area in 2024 both in engineering and compute resources reported Mark Zuckerberg Metas boss at the end of last year. Story continues Elsewhere though plans are more modest. Exclude firms driving the AI revolution such as Microsoft and Nvidia and those in the SP 500 are planning to lift capex by only around 2.5% in 2024i.e. by an amount in line with inflation. Across the economy as a whole the situation is even bleaker. An American capex tracker produced by Goldman Sachs a bank offers a picture of businesses outlays as well as hinting at future intentions. It is currently falling by 4% year on year. Surely with all the excitement about generative AIs potential spending on information technologies is at least soaring Not quite. In the third quarter of 2023 American firms investment in information-processing equipment and software fell by 0.4% year on year. Similar trends are observable at a global level. According to national-accounts data for the OECD club of mostly rich countries which go up to the third quarter of 2023 investment spendingincluding by governmentsis growing more slowly than in the pre-pandemic years. A high-frequency measure of global capex from JPMorgan Chase another bank points to minimal growth. With weak capex it is no surprise that there is little sign of productivity improvements according to a real-time measure derived from surveys of purchasing managers (see chart). An official survey in Japan does point to sharply higher capex growth in the future after years of sluggishness. Yet this probably reflects factors specific to that country such as reforms to corporate governance. And in most places outside America the situation is rather less encouraging. A worsening outlook for the economy in Europe does not help. Investment intentions of services companies in the European Union are less than half as ambitious as they were in early 2022. British businesses plan to raise capex by a mere 3% over the next year compared with 10% when asked in early 2022. These trends suggest one of two things. The first is that generative AI is a busted flush. Big tech firms love the technology but are going to struggle to find customers for the products and services that they have spent tens of billions of dollars creating. It would not be the first time in recent history that technologists have overestimated demand for new innovations. Think of cryptocurrencies and the metaverse. The second interpretation is less gloomy and more likely. The adoption of new general-purpose technologies tends to take time. Return to the example of the personal computer. Microsoft released a groundbreaking operating system in 1995 but American firms only ramped up spending on software in the late 1990s. Analysis by Goldman Sachs suggests that while only 5% of chief executives expect AI to have a significant impact on their business within one to two years 65% think it will have an impact in the next three to five. AI is still likely to change the economy but with a whimper not a bang.  2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved. From The Economist published under licence.

       " 'headline: Generative AI is miracle technology for profit-hungry CEOs: PwC survey.  content: Step aside CFOs: New generative AI technology stands to supplant you as your CEOs best friend. This in part reflects how the latest crop of powerful tech can unlock major impact on worker productivity and corporate financials according to a new study of CEOs by consultancy PwC. The survey was released ahead of an AI-themed World Economic Forum kicking off on Tuesday in Davos Switzerland. About 68% of US CEOs surveyed say that the next 12 months will see generative AI increasing the amount of work that employees can accomplish. That number is 64% globally according to PwC. Roughly half of US CEOs expect the technology to help them become more productive in their own work. The productivity boost should serve up a jolt to profits CEOs contend. Nearly 44% of the CEOs questioned say they see generative AI providing a net increase in profits in the next 12 months versus just 3% anticipating a net decrease. Investors are also increasingly demanding executives pursue profitable growth prompting many CEOs to turn not only to cost containment strategies but also to GenAI explained PwC. Whats alluring about GenAI is its dual ability to produce efficiency gains that hold down current expenses while simultaneously enabling company reinvention. This may mean that when the macroeconomic headwinds abate the stage is set for a potentially faster rate of growth on a lower cost basis. PwC adds that 2024 is shaping up to be the year of business model reinvention. Prior research from PwC puts a bow on the broader generative AI economic impact. AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030 more than the current output of China and India combined. The greatest economic gains from generative AI says PwC will be in China (an approximate 26% boost to GDP in 2030) and North America (a roughly 14.5% GDP jolt). To be sure investors have been positioning to capture any major upside in profit increases. Story continues Stock indexes such as the SP 500 ( GSPC ) Dow Jones Industrial Average ( DJI ) and Nasdaq Composite ( IXIC ) continue to hover around record highs in 2024. Large-cap tech companies with outsized AI exposure such as Microsoft Alphabet and Amazon remain top picks amongst Wall Street analysts. And the share price of generative AI chip giant  and market darling  Nvidia has pushed to fresh records in 2024s early going. In total Wall Street currently expects SP 500 profits to grow an impressive 11% in 2024 as new AI tools proliferate and inflation cools. Last year SP 500 profits grew about 3% as companies invested aggressively in the first tranche of generative AI and dealt with lingering inflation. The potential rewards from large and transformative impacts of GenAI still outweigh the rising investor expectations implied by solid CY23 stock performance said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a client note seen by Yahoo Finance.

       " 'headline: IMF warns AI will impact 60% of US jobs increase inequality worldwide.  content: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is sounding the alarm that generative artificial intelligence could impact a significant share of jobs worldwide and warned the technologys disruption of the global labor market could exacerbate inequality and fuel further social unrest. The organization which monitors the global economy and financial system is urging countries to implement policies to help ensure responsible adoption of the technology. In a blog post on Sunday the IMF pointed to a staff analysis of Gen-AIs impact on the future of work which estimates Gen-AI will affect 40% of jobs worldwide hitting 60% of those in advanced economies like the U.S. 40% in emerging markets and 26% in developing nations. The study determined AI will have the most immediate impact on larger economies with highly skilled workers whose positions are at the greatest threat of replacement. It found roughly half the exposed jobs in developed nations would likely be complemented by AI because it would enhance their roles and make them more efficient. The remaining half exposed to AI are under threat of falling in lower demand or even being eliminated in some instances the report said. JAMIE DIMON WEIGHS IN ON AI SAYS ONLY GOD KNOWS WHAT THE TECH WILL DO FOR HUMANITY Although countries with emerging and developing markets will face less disruption from AI in the short term the IMF warned that those nations lack of infrastructure and skilled workforces enhances the risk that AI will deepen inequality among economies. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP The report raised further concerns that AI could broaden inequalities within nations as workers who embrace AI see their incomes rise while those who shun it will fall behind. It points out that older workers who are more hesitant to embrace AI are more vulnerable than younger workers. DESPITE THE HYPE OVER GENERATIVE AI MOST CEOS ARE TAKING A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH In most scenarios AI will likely worsen overall inequality a troubling trend that policymakers must proactively address to prevent the technology from further stoking social tensions the IMFs blog post reads. It is crucial for countries to establish comprehensive social safety nets and offer retraining programs for vulnerable workers. In doing so we can make the AI transition more inclusive protecting livelihoods and curbing inequality. Story continues In its report the IMF recommends advanced and emerging nations develop regulatory frameworks to optimize the benefits of AI responsibly while advising low-income countries to boost investments in infrastructure and workforce training to help them catch up.

       " 'headline: A huge private equity tech investor predicts who will win the AI wave.  content: This is The Takeaway from todays Morning Brief which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What were watching What were reading Economic data releases and earnings In almost every conversation so far this week at the World Economic Forum generative AI has come up. In our interviews on and off the record Brian Sozzi and I have been hearing about whether it needs to be regulated how companies are integrating it the speed at which its moving how its being monetized. And we got a bit of a framework on how to invest in it from Robert Smith the founder chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners. The firm has about $100 billion in assets under management mostly invested in enterprise technology companies. First of all he points out that it will be integrated into how companies operate just like past innovations like the internet and the cloud. So how will money be deployed The first wave is going to ultimately go to the hardware vendors Smith told us in an interview. The next wave will be these super scalers like Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet. The long tail is going to be the enterprise software companies. The small and medium businesses arent going to build their own solutions tests. Theyre going to come to their enterprise software vendors and ask How do we utilize gen AI to create more effective and efficient productivity in our businesses To be fair Smith is an enterprise software guy so it makes sense he sees opportunity there. And of course the enterprise software companies echo his sentiment. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott is already seeing demand for generative AI services flow to his bottom line. He said the discussions in Davos are making it abundantly clear that CEOs believe they need to invest. These CEOs that are here know that theyre investing heavily in technology because generative AI in particular can give them an outcome. So its not technology for technologys sake he said in an interview . This year $5 trillion will be spent on technology most of it on software and services. And gen AI is the moment in which the CEOs are no longer thinking about investing. They know they have to invest because if they dont and their competitor does they may not be around too long. Story continues That said these CEOs are talking their book. And there are others who think the hype has gotten ahead of itself. Much like the enthusiasm surrounding autonomous driving that took more time and complexity to deliver generative AI-powered everything might not be here quite yet. 2024 is going to be kind of the year of the AI letdown said Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince . I dont think these products are going to come in 2024. They may not even come in 2025. I think theyre coming but its actually going to take us learning how to do engineering in a different sort of way.

       " 'headline: AI will spur more hiring not less as it enables more ingenuity per person says Adobes Scott Belsky.  content: Artificial intelligence will lead to mass unemployment or create more jobs depending on who you ask. So which view is right Few people have better insight into this question than Scott Belsky Adobes chief strategy officer and executive vice president of design and emerging products. Belsky has seen first-hand how graphic designers are adopting recently introduced AI features in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator that save them timeand heard questions from companies about whether such tools mean theres less need to hire more creative talent given the increased efficiency made possible. Ive been involved with a lot of these conversations with companies Belsky said in a Wednesday episode of the Big Technology podcast. I always explain first of all engineers have gotten more productive over the last few decades and guess what happens People keep hiring more engineers. Why Because they get more ingenuity per person and they want more people because they wanna do more things. Graphic designers are also becoming more productive thanks to AI. Belsky described how Adobe took an idea from its Illustrator for iPad app (not a hugely popular product) the contextual task bar and applied it to Photoshop. That one innovation changed everything for us in Photoshop he said. The bar gives designers options to use generative AI capabilities based on where they are in the workflow. It might indicate that Generative Expand is available for instance allowing empty space around an image to be filled with newly generated content that naturally blends with the existing image as Adobes website describes it . The adoption of such tools is higher than probably any other feature Adobe introduced in the past decade Belsky said. Ive never met a creative professional that wants to take two hours to do something that they could achieve in two minutes or two seconds he said. No one wants to do things the long way. The question is what are they going to do with a lot of their new-found time. Story continues Some CEOs react with paranoia to how employees might use that new-found time. But with designers Belsky said: When you give them that time back you know what theyre going to do instead Theyre gonna run more A/B tests of different images as opposed to resizing the same images. Theyre gonna start to explore different possibilities and propose maybe better solutions. AI to generate jobs In a similar way companies themselves will start to expand and branch out as they become more efficient thanks to new AI capabilities Belsky believes. Unless youre a penny-pinching private-equity-owned company you are probably a company that actually wants to build more products more features more marketing campaigns across more platforms and more regions with more testing he said. As companies get more out of each person on average he said they want to hire more people because you end up wanting to do more things to grow your business. That desire he said might be a natural human tendency of capitalism if not just humanity overall. Belsky is not alone in this view. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangwhose companys shares have jumped more than 240% this year thanks to booming demand for its AI chipsshared his own upbeat outlook about AI in an interview with the Acquired podcast a few months ago. My sense is that its likely to generate jobs Huang said. The first thing that happens with productivity is prosperity. When companies get more successful they hire more people because they want to expand into more areas. A common line of thinking he noted is that if a company improves productivity with AI then it will employ fewer people. But that assumes a company will have no new ideas and thats not true for most companies. For a darker view look no further than Elon Musk . At a recent AI summit in Britain the Tesla CEO told Prime Minister Rishi Sunak that AI is the most disruptive force in human history and that there will come a point where no job is neededOne of the challenges in the future will be how do we find meaning in life. AI boosts small companies As Belsky sees it AI will not only lead to more ingenuity per person but also far greater opportunities for smaller companies to compete against bigger ones. Im particularly bullish for small companies he said because theyll start to gain the advantages of big corporations without having to become bulky. AI will give small companies for instance the power of data analysisusually enjoyed by bigger companiesas well as better capabilities in marketing and content creation as AI handles more of these functions. Youre going to see many many more smaller companies have great businesses as a result of this technology he said. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com',\n",
       " 'headline: Cognizant Impact Study Predicts Generative AI Could Inject $1 Trillion Into U.S. Economy Over 10 Years.  content: Joint landmark Oxford Economics/Cognizant study predicts generative AI will affect 90% of U.S. jobs underscoring the critical need for strategic reskilling to maintain economic growth TEANECK N.J.  Jan. 11 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In partnership with Oxford Economics Cognizant (NASDAQ: CTSH) today revealed findings from its new economic impact study New Work New World  which predicted that 90% of jobs will be disrupted in some way by generative AI (gen AI) setting the stage for a profound shift in how we approach work productivity and economic growth. The study also found that the technologys impact will be influenced by the rate of business adoption and how quickly individuals can adapt to new ways of working. Our study aims to lift the curtain on the effects generative AI may have on our global workforce said Adrian Cooper  CEO at Oxford Economics. The research findings showcase just how quickly this technology might disrupt the trajectory of the U.S. economy offering invaluable insights for leaders to harness its potential and adapt swiftly. Generative AI offers the potential to improve operational efficiency create new revenue streams innovate products and services and ultimately redefine businesses. To quantify generative AIs potential impact on productivity and the future of work Cognizant partnered with Oxford Economics to create an economic model that explores three scenarios of U.S. businesses generative AI adoption. This model considered 18000 tasks that drive the U.S. economy and carefully examines the impact Generative AI may have on the jobs that ladder up to these tasks. While focused on the U.S. workforce the general themes that emerged from the findings can be applied globally. The research unveiled key insights including: AI adoption will skyrocket over the next decade before settling into maturity : Businesses are in the experimental phase of adoption for AI capabilities. However the findings reveal that adoption could leap from 13% to 31% in just four to eight years. After the 15-year mark the findings predict that adoption may slow but will continue to grow for at least 15 more years. Economic advancement could soar : Generative AI technology could boost U.S. productivity by 1.7-3.5% and grow the U.S. GDP between $477 billion and $1 trillion in annual value over the next 10 years based on business adoption rates. Simultaneously the job market could be disrupted : Half of all jobs (52%) are predicted to significantly change as generative AI is integrated to automate job tasks. As a result approximately 9% of the current U.S. workforce may be displaced with 1% potentially struggling to find new employment based on historical economic shifts. Jobs with higher levels of knowledge work may be most affected : In the past technology advances and automation have impacted mainly manual labor and process-centric knowledge work. Generative AI is poised to do the opposite having a higher disruption on knowledge work. Additionally jobs involving credit analysis computer programming web development database administration and graphic design already have a theoretical maximum exposure score of about 50%. By 2032 as technology advances some jobs exposure scores may climb to 80%. Even CEOs will feel an impact : The data found that C-Suite executives  even CEOs  could see a theoretical maximum exposure score (the degree to which a jobs tasks are prone to being automated by generative AI) of more than 25% as they begin using gen AI for everything from competitive assessments to strategic decision-making. Story continues Generative AI has already astonished us with its capabilities across industries but the true impact of its integration in our daily business operations has just scratched the surface said Ravi Kumar S Chief Executive Officer Cognizant. To apply the technologys potential to amplify our productivity we must understand its full influence on the future of work and come together to create the best opportunities for people to grow alongside it. Reskilling The Workforce as AI Advances While the timeline of this research spans more than a decade Cognizant believes that leaders across all sectors of society should work together today to establish a new trust compact that will enable businesses workers and economies to thrive in the age of generative AI. As this technology becomes commonplace in the workforce new employee skills will be in demand to support areas including business strategy and AI management. Reskilling programs once seen as a tactical add-on to an employees career path will become an essential part of the workday with time allocated for training and education. In line with this vision Cognizant recently launched its Synapse initiative designed to revolutionize and rebalance the landscape of tech education and workforce development by redefining opportunities for more than one million individuals worldwide. Drawing on Cognizants deep expertise and long history as a tech reskiller the initiative aims to create a new employable talent pool for the expanding digital economy by 2026.

       " 'headline: OpenAI seeks to allay election meddling fears in blog post.  content: By Anna Tong SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - - Artificial intelligence lab OpenAI published a blog post Monday seeking to address fears that its technology will meddle with elections as more than a third of the globe prepares to head to the polls this year. The use of AI to interfere with election integrity has been a concern since the Microsoft-backed company released two products: ChatGPT which can mimic human writing convincingly and DALL-E whose technology can be used to create deepfakes or realistic-looking images that are fabricated. Those worried include OpenAIs own CEO Sam Altman who testified in Congress in May that he was nervous about generative AIs ability to compromise election integrity through one-on-one interactive disinformation. The San Francisco-based company said that in the United States which will hold presidential elections this year it is working with the National Association of Secretaries of State an organization that focuses on promoting effective democratic processes such as elections. ChatGPT will direct users to CanIVote.org when asked certain election-related questions it added. The company also said it is working on making it more obvious when images are AI-generated using DALL-E and is planning to put a cr icon on images to indicate it was AI-generated following a protocol created by the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity. It is also working on ways to identify DALL-E-generated content even after images have been modified. In its blog post OpenAI emphasized that its policies prohibit its technology to be used in ways it has identified as potentially abusive such as creating chatbots pretending to be real people or discouraging voting. It also prohibits DALL-E from creating images of real people including political candidates it said. The company faces challenges policing what is actually happening on its platform. Story continues When Reuters last year tried to create images of Donald Trump and Joe Biden the request was blocked and a message appeared saying it may not follow our content policy. Reuters however was able to create images of at least a dozen other U.S. politicians including former Vice President Mike Pence. (Reporting by Anna Tong in San Francisco editing by Miral Fahmy)',\n",

       " 'headline: Getty Images launches a new GenAI service for iStock customers.  content: Getty Images the stock media company announced a new service this week at CES 2024 that leverages AI models trained on Gettys iStock stock photography and video libraries to generate new licensable images and artwork. Called Generative AI by iStock the service powered in part by tech from Nvidia has been designed to guard against generations of known products people places or other copyrighted elements Getty claims. Available in 75 languages it can modify images as well as generate new ones and optionally be integrated with existing apps and plug-ins via an API. The cost is $15 per 100 generated images. Our main goal with Generative AI by iStock is to provide customers with an easy and affordable option to use AI in their creative process without fear that something that is legally protected has snuck into the data set and could end up in their work Grant Farhall iStocks chief product officer said in a press release. A range of images created with Gettys new Generative AI by iStock. Image Credits: Getty Images The launch of Generative AI by iStock -- Gettys second GenAI tool -- comes as the copyright debate over AI heats up. GenAI models which learn from billions of examples of artwork e-books essays and more to generate human-like text and images tend to regurgitate those examples when prompted in particular ways. (See the fake Disney posters generated by Microsofts chatbot.) Thats problematic in cases where the examples are under copyright and the creator of the model didnt obtain permission -- or pay a fee -- to use them. In a piece published this week in IEEE Spectrum noted AI critic Gary Marcus and Reid Southen a visual effects artist show how AI systems including OpenAIs DALL-E 3  regurgitate data even when not specifically prompted to do so. [Theres] no publicly available tool or database that users could consult to determine possible infringement nor any instruction to users as how they might possibly do so they write. Story continues Some companies developing GenAI apps argue that theyre protected by fair use doctrine at least in the U.S. But its a matter thats unlikely to be settled anytime soon. Over the past year or so artists have filed suit against Stability AI Midjourney and DeviantArt arguing that models released by the companies infringe on their copyrights by training on the artists works and generating outputs in their styles. Separately Getty Images has sued Stability AI for allegedly copying and processing millions of images and associated metadata owned by Getty in the U.K. A handful of vendors have begun offering to pay the legal fees of customers implicated in copyright lawsuits arising from their use of GenAI tools. Generative AI by iStock has a policy along those lines too -- presumably as a last resort of sorts. Any licensed visual that a Generative AI by iStock customer generates comes with $10000 in legal coverage Getty says.

       " 'headline: AI is the buzz the big opportunity and the risk to watch among the Davos glitterati.  content: DAVOS Switzerland (AP)  Artificial intelligence is easily the biggest buzzword for world leaders and corporate bosses diving into big ideas at the World Economic Forums glitzy annual meeting in Davos. Breathtaking advances in generative AI stunned the world last year and the elite crowd is angling to take advantage of its promise and minimize its risks . In a sign of ChatGPT maker OpenAIs skyrocketing profile CEO Sam Altman is making his Davos debut to rock star crowds with his benefactor Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella hot on his heels. Illustrating AIs geopolitical importance like few other technologies before it the word was on the lips of world leaders from China to France. It was visible across the Swiss Alpine town and percolated through afterparties. Heres a look at the buzz: OPENAI OPENING BIG AT DAVOS The leadership drama at the AI worlds much-ballyhooed chatbot maker followed Altman and Nadella to the swanky Swiss snows. Altman who was suddenly fired last year by OpenAIs board and then swiftly reinstated  said at a Bloomberg event that he was focused on getting a great full board in place and would consider changes down the road to the companys unusual structure which is governed by a nonprofit. He deflected further questions interrupting a question directed at an OpenAI executive accompanying him by saying Is really what you want to spend our time on the soap opera rather than what AGI is going to do AGI is artificial general intelligence a term for the better-than-human AI technology OpenAI is seeking to build. With that on the horizon Altman talked technology and humanity on a panel Thursday. Nadella meanwhile said Im comfortable I have no issues with any structure of the operating model at OpenAI the startup Microsoft has poured billions into. At another Bloomberg event he noted that what I would like is good governance and real stability. Forum founder Klaus Schwab quizzed the Microsoft CEO on whether world leaders were up to the task of creating AI regulations but steered well clear of questions about OpenAIs governance. Story continues WORLD LEADERS WANT TO LEAD THE WORLD ON AI From China to Europe top officials staked their positions on AI as the world grapples with regulating the rapidly developing technology that has big implications for workplaces  elections and privacy. The European Union has devised the worlds first comprehensive AI rules ahead of a busy election year with AI-powered misinformation and disinformation the biggest risk to the global economy as it threatens to erode democracy and polarize society according to a World Economic Forum report released last week. Chinese Premier Li Qiang called AI a double-edged sword. Human beings must control the machines instead of having the machines control us he said in a speech Tuesday. AI must be guided in a direction that is conducive to the progress of humanity so there should be a redline in AI development  a red line that must not be crossed without elaborating. China one of the worlds centers of AI development wants to step up communication and cooperation with all parties on improving global AI governance Li said. China has released interim regulations for managing generative AI but the EU broke ground with its AI Act  which won a hard-fought political deal last month and awaits final sign-off. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said AI is a very significant opportunity if used in a responsible way. She said the global race is already on to develop and adopt AI and touted the 27-nation EUs efforts including the AI Act and a program pairing supercomputers with small and midsized businesses to train large AI models. French President Emmanuel Macron said hes a strong believer in AI and that his country is an attractive and competitive country for the industry. He played up Frances role in helping coordinate regulation on deepfake images and videos created with AI as well as plans to host a follow-up summit on AI safety after an inaugural gathering in Britain in October. ITS ALL IN WHAT THE GLITTERATI SEES The letters AI were omnipresent along the Davos Promenade where consulting firms and tech giants are among the groups that swoop onto the main drag each year renting out shops and revamping them into showcase pavilions. Inside the main conference center a giant digital wall emanated rolling images of AI art and computer-generated conceptions of wildlife and nature like exotic birds or tropical streams. Davos-goers who wanted to delve more deeply into the technical ins and outs of artificial intelligence could drop in to sessions at the AI House. THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE Generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Googles Bard captivated the world by rapidly spewing out new poems images and computer code and are expected to have a sweeping impact on life and work . The technology could help give a boost to the stagnating global economy  said Nadella whose company is rolling out the technology in its products. The Microsoft chief said hes very optimistic about AI being that general purpose technology that drives economic growth. Business leaders predicted AI will help automate mundane work tasks or make it easier for people to do advanced jobs but they also warned that it would threaten workers who cant keep up. A survey of 4700 CEOs in more than 100 countries by PwC released at the start of the Davos meetings said 14% think theyll have to lay off staff because of the rise of generative AI. There isnt an area there isnt an industry thats not going to be impacted by AI said Julie Sweet CEO of consulting firm Accenture. For those who can move with the change AI promises to transform tasks like computer coding customer relations and streamline business functions like invoicing IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said. If you embrace AI youre going to make yourself a lot more productive he said. If you do not ... youre going to find that you do not have a job. ALSO ITS SEXY During a session featuring Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun talk about risks and regulation led to the moderators hypothetical example of infinitely conversant sexbots that could be built by anyone using open source technology. Taking the high road LeCun replied that AI cant be dominated by a handful of Silicon Valley tech giants AI if its going to serve people around the world with different languages cultures and values. You do not want this to be under the control of a small number of private companies he said.  Chan reported from London.

       " 'headline: The year of does this serve us and the rejection of reification.  content: 2024 has arrived  and with it a renewed interest in artificial intelligence which seems like itll probably continue to enjoy at least middling hype throughout the year. Of course its being cheerled by techno-zealot billionaires and the flunkies bunked within their cozy islands of influence primarily in Silicon Valley -- and derided by fabulists who stand to gain from painting the still-fictional artificial general intelligence (AGI) as humanitys ur-bogeyman for the ages. Both of these positions are exaggerated and untenable e/acc versus decel arguments be damned. Speed without caution only ever results in compounding problems that proponents often suggest are best-solved by pouring on more speed possibly in a different direction to arrive at some idealized future state where the problems of the past are obviated by the super powerful Next Big Thing of the future calls to abandon or regress entire areas of innovation meanwhile ignore the complexity of a globalized world where cats generally can not be put back into boxes universally among many many other issues with that kind of approach. The long thrilling and tumultuous history of technology development particularly in the age of the personal computer and the internet has shown us that in our fervor for something new we often neglect to stop and ask but is the new thing also something we want or need. We never stopped to ask that question with things like Facebook and they ended up becoming an inextricable part of the fabric of society an eminently manipulable but likewise essential part of crafting and sharing in community dialog. Heres the main takeaway from the rise of social media that we should carry with us into the advent of the age of AI: Just because something is easier or more convenient doesnt make it preferable -- or even desirable. LLM-based so-called AI has already infiltrated our lives in ways that will likely prove impossible to wind back even if we wanted to do such a thing but that doesnt mean we have to indulge in the escalation some see as inevitable wherein we relentlessly rip out human equivalents of some of the gigs that AI is already good at or shows promise in to make way for the necessary forward march of progress. Story continues The oft-repeated counter to fears that increased automation or handing menial work over to AI agents is that itll always leave people more time to focus on quality work as if dropping a couple of hours per day spent on filling in Excel spreadsheets will leave the office admin who was doing that work finally free to compose the great symphony theyve had locked away within them or to allow the entry-level graphic designer who had been color-correcting photos the liberty to create a lasting cure for COVID. In the end automating menial work might look good on paper and it might also serve the top executives and deep-pocketed equity-holders behind an organization through improved efficiency and decreased costs but it doesnt serve the people who might actually enjoy doing that work or who at least dont mind it as part of the overall mix that makes up a work life balanced between more mentally taxing and rewarding creative/strategic exercises and day-to-day low-intensity tasks. And the long-term consequence of having fewer people doing this kind of work is that youll have fewer overall who are able to participate meaningfully in the economy -- which is ultimately bad even for those rarified few sitting at the top of the pyramid who reap the immediate rewards of AIs efficiency gains. Utopian technologist zeal always fails to recognize that the bulk of humanity (techno-zealots included) are sometimes lazy messy disorganized inefficient error-prone and mostly satisfied with the achievement of comfort and the avoidance of boredom or harm. That might not sound all that aspirational to some but I say it with a celebratory fervor since for me all those human qualities are just as laudable as less attainable ones like drive ambition wealth and success. Im not arguing against halting or even slowing the development of promising new technology including LLM-based generative AI. And to be clear where the consequences are clearly beneficial -- e.g. developing medical image diagnosis tech that far exceeds the accuracy of trained human reviewers or developing self-driving car technology that can actually drastically reduce the incidence of car accidents and loss of human life -- there is no cogent argument to be made for turning away from use of said tech. But in almost all cases where the benefits are painted as efficiency gains for tasks that are far from life or death Id argue its worth a long hard look at whether we need to bother in the first place yes human time is valuable and winning some of that back is great but assuming thats always a net positive ignores the complicated nature of being a human being and how we measure and feel our worth. Saving someone so much time they no longer feel like theyre contributing meaningfully to society isnt a boon no matter how eloquently you think you can argue they should then use that time to become a violin virtuoso or learn Japanese.

       " 'headline: Nextech3D.ais Breakthrough AI Powered Search Engine Able to Deliver a 500% Increase in Productivity.  content: TORONTO ON / ACCESSWIRE / January 18 2024 / Nextech3D.ai (OTCQX:NEXCF)(CSE:NTAR)(FSE:1SS) a Generative AI-Powered 3D model supplier for major e-commerce retailers announces its recently launched AI 3D model search engine can deliver up to a 500% increase in the production of 3D models which is a marked increase from its previously announced 80% increase in productivity. The Company plans on releasing its AI search engine to the public in Q1 2024 for general use and charging on a per use basis which could contribute significantly to the Companys growth in 2024. CEO Evan Gappelberg recently joined Proactive Investors to discuss the 500% increase in productivity and breakthrough AI 3D model search engine - watch here As previously mentioned the Company plans on continuously providing reports on the AI and its ability to increase productivity and lower costs of 3D model production over time. As more searches are conducted and the tool is used more frequently the AI learns and becomes progressively more productive. In a recent press release the Company initially reported an 80% increase in productivity . Upon further research based upon Nextech3D.ais own internal usage of thousands of searches over the last 2 weeks the Company reports an updated 500% increase in 3D modeling productivity. The 500% increase in productivity is due to an 80% reduction in time it takes to create a 3D model by using the 3D model search engine. Instead of a 3D artist having to create an intricate or complex 3D model from scratch they are able to find a similar 3D model quad or triangle mesh using the AI search engine and then modify it as needed. This groundbreaking AI-driven search engine quickly locates comparable model meshes in Nextechs extensive library which houses hundreds of thousands of 3D parts and meshes. Within mere seconds a 3D artist can select from a variety of 3D matches taking advantage of the librarys existing collection of 3D models that share similar colors textures and shapes. Story continues Watch a demo of the AI-Powered 3D model search engine tool - click here Earlier this month the Company announced it had gone live with its proprietary AI-Powered 3D model search engine. This cutting-edge AI search engine combines computer vision and artificial intelligence to enhance and expedite the 3D modeling process. By leveraging this proprietary technology the Company aims to streamline and accelerate its in-house 3D model production operations significantly. In addition it plans to sell its search engine to others which could lead to significant revenue and profit growth. The AI-based search engine operates by the user showing the search engine an image - the AI then goes to work searching through Nextechs extensive internal library of hundreds of thousands of 3D product models and parts and suggests a close match to the provided image. In just a few seconds the 3D artist is able to choose from multiple 3D models that closely match the image and fine tune the pre-built 3D model into a net new 3D model which creates another searchable new mesh. The constant creation of new 3D models creates a virtuous cycle and a tremendous amount of value for the platform. The Company sees this as a breakthrough in 3D modeling and is expecting to launch a general purpose version that can become the gold standard for the massive global $5.5 trillion dollar e-commerce market which is pivoting to 3D models from flat 2D photos in Q1 2024. Recent News Nextech3D.ais Breakthrough AI Powered Search Engine Reports an 80% Increase In 3D Modeling Productivity Nextech3D.ai Announces Six New 2024 3D Modeling Contracts  Renewals Nextech3D.ai Launches AI Powered Search Engine To Scale The Production of 3D Models Sign up for Investor News and Info - Click Here About Nextech3D.ai Nextech3D.ai or the Company (OTCQX:NEXCF)(CSE:NTAR)(FSE:1SS) is a versatile augmented reality and AI technology company that utilizes its proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) to craft immersive 3D experiences at scale for E-COMMERCE. The Companys primary focus lies in creating high-quality 3D WebAR photorealistic models for Amazon and various other online retailers. Nextech3D.ai has adopted a unique approach to creating shareholder value beyond its operating business of creating 3D models.

       " 'headline: Microsoft (MSFT) OpenAI Face Charges From The New York Times.  content: Microsoft MSFT and OpenAI the creator of the popular artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT have been accused of copyright infringement and are facing a lawsuit by The New York Times NYT for abusing the newspapers intellectual property to train large language models (LLMs). The lawsuit contends that the companies gave particular emphasis to The New York Times content without proper authorization or compensation potentially leading to billions of dollars in damages. It also emphasizes the vital importance of The Timess independent journalism to democracy describing it as increasingly rare and valuable. The dispute highlights the growing legal and ethical challenges associated with the use of copyrighted materials in training AI models particularly LLMs like ChatGPT and the potential for spreading misinformation without proper attribution to the original source. The lawsuit in this case does not specify a monetary claim but suggests that OpenAI and Microsoft should be held responsible for substantial damages. With any legal dispute the outcome remains uncertain and both parties may continue negotiations or proceed with the legal process. Despite the tensions OpenAI has announced partnerships with entities like Axel Springer to incorporate recent and authoritative content into ChatGPT with an emphasis on transparency and attribution. This move seems to be an attempt to address concerns and showcase a collaborative approach with publishers. Microsoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation price-consensus-chart  Microsoft Corporation Quote MSFT Leads the Race for AI Revenues Through OpenAI Microsoft which has gained 56.8% on a year-to-date basis is being propelled by the success of ChatGPT. It is continuously making significant strides by integrating OpenAIs latest LLM GPT-4 into its Bing search engine and Edge browser. Additionally Microsoft Azure provides the Azure OpenAI Service facilitating the seamless application of LLMs and generative AI techniques across various applications. Further this Zacks Rank 3 (Hold) company recently announced OpenAIs DALL-E 3 AI image-synthesis model which is fully integrated with ChatGPT and challenges previous models by rendering images with complex descriptions and handling in-image text generation.

What is interesting for us of course is what is the real relationship between OpenAI and Microsoft when it comes to control of the business in question Margrethe Vestager said Thursday in an interview with Bloomberg Television during a visit to the US. The recent firing  and subsequent rehiring  of OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman exposed just how linked the two companies have become. Microsoft shares which has invested more than $13 billion in the ChatGPT maker negotiated directly for the return of Altman. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella even offered Altman and all other OpenAI employees jobs at Microsoft if they chose to leave. Eventually most of OpenAIs board resigned and Altman was reinstated as CEO. Microsoft executive Dee Templeton also gained a seat as a nonvoting observer on OpenAIs board.

       " 'headline: Google Cloud exec: Enterprise AI is game-changing but companies need to prepare their data.  content: Alphabets ( GOOG  GOOGL ) Google has played many parts in the mythology of AI  leader innovator and even lagger. Though Google was initially caught flat-footed as the popularity of OpenAIs ChatGPT surged it remains impossible to talk about artificial intelligence without talking about the search giant. Naturally Google Cloud which raked in more than $26 billion in 2022 is front and center in the enterprise AI race with Amazons ( AMZN ) AWS and Microsofts ( MSFT ) Azure. That means that for Brian Goldstein Google Clouds global GM of AI go to market life has changed a lot over the last year. Goldstein and I first met when I moderated a panel he was on at UCLA and I was intrigued by his candor  hes willing to humorously bristle at the mention of ChatGPT bringing into focus a reality: Googles had the advantage of being a verb for search for so long but the market has shifted  and the lack of that similar advantage in AI stings. Especially since theres so much history there  Goldstein showed me an interview with Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin from 2000 in which the two men say point-blank that they believe the future of Google is AI. Goldstein sat down with Yahoo Finance to unpack what the future of AI in enterprise looks like why companies need to get their data in order and more. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Tell me the story of AI from your perspective and Googles. Its a great question let me try to parse through both points of view. The evidence lies in Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] discussing Google becoming an AI-enabled search platform right from the companys inception. So I dont consider AI as something new to Google. Were the company that either invented or played a role in inventing and then open-sourced many of the pivotal advancements that have shaped this entire market and ecosystem enabling it to mature at todays pace. Story continues The significant shift today or I should say in the past year or even the last 20-some years is the intense spotlight on AI. People now understand and pay attention to it its suddenly highly relevant. Personally my experience with AI stems from my role at Google overseeing a large data market organization catering to customers of various sizes and needs across the entire portfolio. Then there was this pivotal moment... Are we going to say it Are we going to call it the ChatGPT moment A magic moment definitely emerged. The tone and tenor of our customers and prospects changed. [C-suite and boardrooms] wanted to learn not just chat about how generative AI could impact our business. They sought reliable insights and few places could offer that assurance except Google. I was unexpectedly given the chance to enter these spaces and discuss the potential of generative AI for businesses. It was a remarkable shift  from spending nearly 30 years knocking on doors to now having doors knocked down with people asking Can you please come in and help us teach us That to me is the magic. Was it an overnight shift or a slow realization I have to tell you it feels like it happened overnight. Ive never in my career experienced a shift like that. The move to mobile the internet or SaaS those things happened over the course of years. This was a moment where we went from business as usual to business not as usual in the course of days. And it hasnt stopped at all ... If anything the demand has increased precipitously. Theres a hunger for the knowledge theres a hunger for the experience. I want to go back to something youve said to me previously: We took a big step forward in generative AI but we need to take a step back and get data right. What does that mean Theres been this incredible groundswell of excitement and everybody knows about this. Were all talking about it around generative AI and jumping in and doing the project and sharing the impact. But that all being said at the other side of these projects what were seeing is that organizations did not have their data house in order. For one they had not appropriately connected all the disparate data sources that make up the most effective outputs in a model. Two so many organizations had not cleansed their data making certain that their data is as appropriate and high value as possible. And so weve heard this forever  garbage in garbage out. You can have this great AI project that has all the tenets of success and everybodys really excited. Then it turns out that the data pipeline isnt great and that the data isnt streamlined  all of a sudden your predictions are not as accurate as they could or should have been. The models are harder to continue to train and theyre not as good as they ought to be. You potentially have a space here where youre not mitigating bias and theres inaccurate data risk that can lead to all kinds of challenges. Lets say theres a CEO reading this and this person wants to get their generative AI project off the ground and still needs to get their data in order. What would you tell them I think you should choose a partner a technology partner who can come in and join forces with you and hold hands and be accountable with you  not just providing software and services but to also be responsible for thinking through the dynamics of what a project would look like. What are the priorities for your business How can we help you figure out where the low-hanging fruit is and where the riskier projects are What does the overall future of AI look like You cannot discount the impact of this multimodal world that we are entering where were leveraging text video image and sound. All these things coming together is going to happen in a way that even though were starting to see it in our real lives  its hard to fathom just how impactful some of this is going to be. Ive imagined my own domain evolving in a way where for example it becomes very commonplace that for a customer conversation theres an AI [assistant] thats helping go-to-market professionals appropriately adjust tone tenor and types of engagement that theyre having with the party on the other side. AI will connect all these disparate resources in a way that allows you to gather insights in real time and provide a provocative approach to business outcomes thats going to be entirely game-changing.

And most importantly, never give up on your dreams!\\n\\nWhat are your hobbies outside of writing?\\n\\nOutside of writing, I enjoy reading (of course), watching movies and TV shows, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family.
