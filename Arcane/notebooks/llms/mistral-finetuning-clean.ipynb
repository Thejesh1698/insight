       "'Convenience Fee: Definition Examples and How to Avoid Them: What Is a Convenience Fee A convenience fee is a fee charged by a seller when a consumer pays with an electronic payment card rather than by a standard form of payment accepted by the business. Standard payments include cash check or an Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer. Convenience fees can be a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of the transaction amount usually 2% to 3% and must be disclosed to the consumer in advance. Types of payments where the payee typically charges a convenience fee include mortgage payments property tax payments college tuition and taxes. Understanding a Convenience Fee Convenience fees can help a business cover some of the costs imposed through electronic payment processing. Businesses have to pay a merchant fee every time one of their customers uses a credit card. For most businesses such as department stores and grocery stores a merchant fee is just a cost of doing business. On the other hand a movie theater or concert venue typically takes payment at the box office so an alternative payment channel such as the phone or online via credit card would result in additional fees for them thus they would charge a convenience fee for doing business in this way. Its important to note that a convenience fee is different than a surcharge. A surcharge is the ability to charge extra just for the benefit of using a credit card while a convenience fee is for a specific use such as taxes or tuition or payment through alternative channels such as by phone or online. Example of a Convenience Fee Suppose that you wanted to pay the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by credit card. The IRS will accept credit card payments through several different payment processing companies and they all charge convenience fees as allowed by the credit card companies. One might charge 2.49% with a $3.95 minimum while another might charge 3.93% with a $2.00 minimum. Thus if you need to send the IRS $2000 and you wanted to pay by credit card you could be required to pay a maximum convenience fee of 0.0393  $2000  $78.60. Convenience Fee Regulations Some people might not mind paying a convenience fee for the benefit of using an electronic payment card particularly if the benefit of earning rewards on the card outweighs the cost of the convenience fee. However this practice is regulated by both state legislation and card networks. As a regulated activity businesses must be cautious in instituting convenience fees and surcharges for customers. Ten states have laws on the book outlawing convenience fees and surcharges but some of these laws have been invalidated by court rulings. However surcharges remain fully illegal in Connecticut Massachusetts and Puerto Rico. For the states that allow merchants to set their own surcharge levels there are caps at approximately 4%. Credit Card Company Policies on Convenience Fees Every credit card provider has different rules on convenience fees. Some are more thorough than others and it may be worth researching the best credit cards to find those with the best policies. Below are the rules of some of the major credit card providers: Mastercard: Allows for convenience fees as long as they are used for all transactions and methods of payment. Visa: Allows for convenience fees only if the payment is through an alternative channel such a by phone or online and the business first notifies the consumer and that the fee is a flat rate not a percentage of the sale. American Express: Has a policy that does not include convenience fees nor surcharges. Discover: Has a policy that also does not include convenience fees nor surcharges. How to Avoid Convenience Fees There are really only two options when it comes to convenience fees either to pay the fee or to use another form of payment such as cash. In many cases some businesses such as gas stations offer discounts when a consumer pays by cash. Its always worth asking a business if they offer a cash discount. Convenience fees are meant to be disclosed at the point of sale so if you discover you have been charged a fee after the fact its important to take this up with your credit card company. How Do You Avoid Convenience Fees for Movie Tickets Some movie theaters charge convenience fees for online or advance orders. If you want to avoid these fees try ordering your ticket at the box office on the day of the show. This runs the risk that your chosen seats may not be available. How Do You Avoid Convenience Fees When Paying Rent Some landlords allow their tenants to pay rent online through a third-party payment system which may charge a percentage of the rent as a convenience fee. Depending on the terms of your lease you may be able to avoid these fees by paying with a check money order cash or other form of non-online payment. Some states prohibit landlords from requiring any form of payment that comes with mandatory surcharges in others it is perfectly legal. What Is the Convenience Fee for Turbotax Intuit charges a 2.49% convenience fee if you choose to pay your taxes with credit card when you file your taxes with TurboTax. The Bottom Line A convenience fee is an additional charge for online or credit card payments sometimes charged by a third-party payment processor. Convenience fees are normally a flat fee or a small percentage of the total payment but they can add up to a substantial sum if the payments are large or recurring. You may be able to avoid convenience fees by paying with cash or another form of payment.'"

       "\"Parasitic, blood-sucking 'alien-like' wasp found in Amazon, eats host from inside outNEW DELHI: Scientists have identified a horrifying and dangerous new species of parasitic wasp that feeds on the blood of its host and devours it from the inside out. The Daily Star reports, this alien-like insect, named Capitojoppa amazonica, was discovered in the Amazon, specifically within the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve in Peru. The parasitic wasp reaches a size of approximately 1.7cm and possesses a tube-like organ that injects an egg into the host's body. It usually targets caterpillars, beetles, and spiders.The wasp was discovered as part of an extensive, ongoing research project. The research team used specialized tent-like traps to capture flying insects in the rainforest. Capitojoppa amazonica is just one out of 109 newly discovered species.Brandon Claridge from Utah State University, who is also the lead author of the study that describes Capitojoppa amazonica, explained to Live Science  Once the host is located and mounted, the female will frantically stroke it with her antennae. If acceptable, the female will deposit a single egg inside the host by piercing it with her ovipositor. The larvae of the wasp consumes the host from the inside out, after the eggs are hatched. They subsequently develop within the deceased host's body before growing into adult wasps.Later, several other wasps gather to feed on the haemolymph, a fluid similar to blood, present inside the host after the expectant mother punctures it with her tube.Claridge stated,  Females will even stab the host with the ovipositor and feed without laying an egg as it helps with gaining nutrients for egg maturation”.Study co-author Ilari Sääksjärvi, from the University of Turku, said,  The species biodiversity of many organisms is highest on the whole planet at Allpahuayo-Mishana”.  Allpahuayo-Mishana is a part of the Amazon that has an unprecedented abundance of species, due to the region's complex geological history”, he added.\""

    "The Indian stock market is facing challenges amid a contracting global landscape. Despite high valuations, factors like high inflation, bond yields, and geopolitical tensions are affecting market sustainability.\n",

    "Indian stock market under pressure due to FII selling (File photo)\n",
    "It’s been a long journey for the Indian stock market. It has been growing well, generating superior wealth in the ongoing century. The Nifty 500, the broader equity index, has provided a decent CAGR of 13.6% over about 23 years. A one-time investment of ₹1 lakh in December 2000 would have been ₹21 lakh today. From the latest intra high of 17,754.05, dated September 12, it went down by 7.25% on October 26, and on November 3, Nifty 50 closed at 17,000.95, which is 4.25% lower. A short-term break in the long-term growing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the onset of the 21st century, the big picture for India was as a rising emerging market as the domestic economy had opened for world business. Initially, the focus was on infrastructure development, particularly in the areas of roads, power and realty, seen as basis fundamental to the new economy. However, it was often characterized as an elephant economy, substantial and steady, driven mainly by domestic demand, and not swiftly adapting to global opportunities. This placid perception has since shifted in the present decade, with the economy now recognized as a burgeoning force poised to become a global supply hub in the future. The multiplier effect is seen in varied sectors like Digital, Renewables, Electronics, Technology, Pharma to Chemical, while efficient working of government expenditure is also uplifting rural and domestic demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Indian economy & fiscal situation are as strong as they have ever been. Projections indicate a stable 6.5% YoY GDP growth from FY24 to FY26, alongside a 5.25% fiscal deficit, even amid global economic deceleration. H1FY24 corporate earnings growth has been bumper, with PAT growth of top 100 large cap estimates at 35% YoY. While no intrinsic structural issues have been identified within India, global circumstances have instigated fluctuations in the stock market, leading to currency volatility. INR has depreciated against USD, 83.270 Friday closing from 82.140 at March-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recent decline in the Indian stock market is predominantly driven by global factors. Notably, there is a conspicuous deceleration in the global economy, as evidenced by Europe's recession, with Germany, the region's foremost manufacturing hub, recording negative GDP growth for the past three quarters. In Asia, the engine growth of China is decelerating. Annual taker of 7% GDP growth, during pre-covid is forecast to settle to 4.5% in the future. It is leading the government to consider implementing a significant stimulus package to regain traction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amid a contracting global landscape, two nations, the US and India, are decoupling. In 2022, the US was projected to enter a recession in the latter part of 2023, however, it managed to avert this scenario through the implementation of a comprehensive $8 trillion COVID assistance package, along with fiscal and monetary stimulus measures introduced by the government between 2020 and 2023. These initiatives had far-reaching benefits, extending support to households, states, healthcare, businesses, and other institutions. Consequently, the likelihood of a recession has now significantly diminished. However, a slowdown is forecast, the annual GDP growth is estimated to reduce from 2.3% in CY23 to 1% in CY24 due to high fiscal deficit, interest rate and quantitative tightening by the US FED.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the primary issue of the global stock market, and the fallout of the world economy. The current global economic landscape stands in contrast to the elevated trajectory of the Indian stock market. It is becoming a challenge to hold the gains due to high FIIs selling in the last 3-4months. Even the optimistic H1 results are not supporting the market to sustain the momentum strong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite long-standing imbalances in the economy, including high inflation, elevated bond yields, geopolitical tensions, and supply constraints, the Indian stock market, like the main indices, has maintained a high valuation. For example, the MSCI India Index has been trading at an average one-year forward P/E of 20.5x above the long-term of 18x. Today at 19.6x, a dichotomy in context to dollar terms with elevated bond yield trading at decades high of 5%. FIIs are cautious as interest rates are expected to stay high, in-stroke to the hawkish central bank view, and economic slowdown and moderation in future earnings are warranting a consolidation in prices and valuations.\n",
