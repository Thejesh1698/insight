On the global level, we expect the prices to hover in the range of USD 1850-2050. Irrespective of the price movement, the consumer demand will continue to grow during the year backed by strengthened purchasing power, and the change in perspective towards gold as lifestyle statement, thus driving sales across along all ticket-sizes.\n",

    "ICRA has analysed the performance of 29 prominent brokerage companies in H1 FY2024. Supported by improved market activity, ICRA’s sample set of companies reported a sharp 20% annualised growth in the net operating income. Given the benefits of economies of scale, the aggregate profitability of this sample set also improved, with a 24% annualised increase in the net profit and a return on equity of 27% in H1 FY2024 compared to 25% in FY2023. ICRA expects the industry to report all-time high revenues and net profits with a year-on-year (YoY) expansion of 18-22% and 22-25%, respectively, in FY2024. \n",

    "\n",
    "The participation of retail investors also remained strong in the futures & options segment, driven by the launch of new index options, miniaturisation of contracts/lot sizes, and separate weekly expiries for each index option.

The market share of non-bank full-service brokers and bank-based brokers stood at ~21% and 14%, respectively, in November 2023.\n",

    "The aggregate leverage of bank brokers, which dominate the MTF segment, increased to 1.9 times as of September 30, 2023, from 0.4 times as of March 31, 2020.

The core reading, which strips out more volatile items like food and energy, is expected to fall to 3.8% year-over-year, from 4% previously. In U.S. economic data, wholesale inventories declined 0.2% in November, according to the Commerce Department.

Technically, after morning intraday correction, Nifty took support near the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) and made a bullish comeback. From the day’s lowest point, the market came up by more than 190/660 points. Traders should consider the 20-day SMA or 21500/71250 as a crucial support level. Above this, the pullback formation is likely to continue. The market has prospects of reaching 21680-21725/71900-72050. However, selling pressure is likely to increase below the 20-day SMA or 21500/71250. If the market slips below that, it may fall to 21400-21355/71000-70800.\n",

U.S. crude oil inventories surged by 1.3 million barrels for the week ending on January 5, contrary to expectations of a 0.7 million barrel decline. The struggle in crude oil prices is attributed to the upsurge in U.S. oil stocks and a stable dollar index. Key U.S. inflation data, set to be released later today, could provide further guidance for oil prices. We anticipate that crude oil prices will continue to be volatile in today’s trading session. Support for crude oil is expected at $70.80–70.10, with resistance at $72.20-73.00 during today’s session.

The Labor Department’s reports on consumer and producer price inflation, which are due to be released on Thursday and Friday, respectively, could significantly impact the outlook for interest rates. Asian markets experienced a notable upswing on Thursday, following the positive momentum in US stocks ahead of the release of inflation data. Japan’s Nikkei extended its record-breaking rally on dovish BOJ bets. Indian market is seen opening flat to slightly higher on Thursday as investors await earnings from IT majors as well as the latest readings on industrial output and retail inflation for directional cues. Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys are set to kickstart Q3 FY2024 earnings on January 11. We expect TCS revenue to be flat sequentially as growth was tepid due to ongoing weaknesses in discretionary spending and layoffs during the quarter. At the same time, Infosys revenue marginally declined QoQ owing to a challenging quarter primarily influenced by sustained weak demand, the absence of certain one-time sales and the impact of layoffs.\n",

We downgrade BPCL to a REDUCE from a BUY, with a target price of INR 475/sh, owing to the risk of (1) lower auto-fuel marketing margins because of either a bounce-back in crude oil price or retail price cuts ahead of general elections and (2) moderation in refining margins.\n",

    "\n",
    "After going through a challenging period marked by (1) an unfavourable rural cycle, (2) deteriorating unit economics, and (3) stumbling in assortment pricing and capital allocation, VMART’s KPIs are bottoming out. Notable improvements include (a) gradual recovery in footfall/sales densities, (b) downward recalibration of rental bills, and (c) alleviation of working capital challenges. We recently interacted with V-MART’s management to better understand the levers to normalcy. Key takeaways include (1) a healthy festive season with 4/10% SSSG/revenue growth in Q3; (2) streamlining of the buying/merchandising process that will aid sourcing margins which could be passed on to the end-consumer to earn higher sales/sq ft and improve WC efficiency; (3) successful performance of new ‘Unlimited’ stores at >INR8,000/sq. ft; and (4) a significant paring of Limeroad losses expected in FY25. Rising competitive intensity concerns seem a false positive as store overlap of major value retailers remains low. Against this backdrop, V-MART resembles a momentarily under-earning asset (awaiting a turn in the rural cycle) more than a melting ice cube. Risk-reward seems favourable @ <20x FY26 EV/EBITDA. Our base case for core VMART bakes in ample margin of safety (FY23-26 sales/sq ft CAGR: 3%; @ INR7.4k and 5.5/6.7% EBITDAM for FY25/26 vs 9.3% in FY19). We upgrade the stock to a BUY with a DCF-based TP of INR2,550/sh (earlier 1,850/sh); implying 23x FY26 EV/EBITDA (FY25/26 EBITDA changes by +21/+7% respectively).\n",

    "\n",
    "The IT sector (coverage universe) is expected to post a weak quarter with a sequential decline. This is due to increased furloughs, Q3 seasonality, a prolonged deal conversion cycle, and compression in discretionary and renewals. Positive factors for the quarter include the ramp-up of mega deals (BSNL/Verizon for TCS/HCLT) and consistent deal activity. However, most of the supply-side indicators, such as tech job postings, remain soft and do not signal any recovery ‘yet’. Although the recent trajectory of rates can support valuation multiples (high inverse correlation), it’s unlikely that tech budgets will improve materially. This is because a ‘slowdown’ in economic growth remains a baseline scenario, leading enterprises to prioritise cost optimization over transformation initiatives. In the Indian IT landscape, we expect three developments: (1) growth divergence within the sector in the near term, (2) margin recovery with favourable supply-side factors, and (3) mid-tier IT sustaining its relative outperformance. However, the margin of safety is low on aggregate, as valuations have approached +2 SD (rerated higher by >20% in the last six months) with limited immediate upside triggers.

    "India’s heterogenous unsecured retail credit market (US$160bn; 3-year CAGR at ~23%) has been in the headlines ever since the RBI clamped down on select categories of consumer credit. Our discussions with experts suggest that the RBI’s note of caution is largely centred on small-ticket personal loans (STPL) (ticket size <INR100k), which account for a high incidence of systemic blind spots, dominant share of incremental disbursements, and elevated early-stage delinquencies, especially across static pools. The RBI’s risk-weight measures are likely to increase the hurdle rate for banks and NBFCs towards unsecured consumer loans, resulting in a material growth deceleration. We continue to hold our below-consensus growth forecasts (1-2 percentage points across our coverage universe) and remain conservative on incremental spreads (blended FY24 NIMs at 15-20bps below FY23 levels), considering the impact on incremental asset mix. Our top picks are ICICIBC (TP: INR1,200) and SBIN (TP: INR780) among large banks; and BAF (TP: INR8650) and SBICARD (TP: INR955) among NBFCs\n",
